Three of these approaches are Mathematical Thinking, Abstract Thinking, and Computational Thinking. Each approach tries to clarify areas of CS that are not directly tied to writing computer programs. In a separate line of research, the current authors have been examining different ways to teach mathematics to CS students. We developed a Computational Math scale that measures the level of problem-solving gestalt exhibited by textbook authors. In this study, we relate our Computational Math framework to current research on Mathematical, Abstract, and Computational (MAC) Thinking. We counted words used frequently in research articles and compared them to words that form the Computational Math scale. Our results suggest an overall MAC Thinking framework that integrates a wide range of topics relevant to computing and programming.},

Our innovative NSF-funded IC2Think project blends computational thinking with creative thinking so that students leverage their creative thinking skills to “unlock” their understanding of computational thinking. In Fall 2012, we deployed creative exercises designed to engage Epstein's creative competencies (Surrounding, Capturing, Challenging and Broadening) in introductory level CS courses targeting four different groups (CS, engineering, combined CS/physical sciences, and humanities majors). Students combined hands-on problem solving with guided analysis and reflection to connect their creative activities to CS topics such as conditionals and arrays and to real-world CS applications. Evaluation results (approximately 150 students) found that creative thinking exercise completion had a linear “dosage” effect. As students completed more exercises [0/1 – 4], they increased their long-term retention [a computational thinking test], F(3, 98) = 4.76, p =.004, partial Eta2 = .127 and course grades, F(3, 109) = 4.32, p =.006, partial Eta2 = .106. These findings support our belief that the addition of creative thinking exercises to CSCE courses improves the learning of computational knowledge and skills.},

Although many examples exist for using critical and computational thinking in STEM educational area, the social sciences i.e., non-STEM areas were somehow left out due to the relatively more difficult design of such content, especially in the part of the development of computational thinking. In that context, in this paper we present one way of using critical and computational thinking in non-STEM education, more specifically on the example of historical data sources, through the use of programming in Python. As an example, we use historical data for Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade routes, that were the largest long-distance coerced movement of people in history up to the mid-nineteenth century, for connecting concepts of databases, Data Science and programming for development of critical and computational thinking in context of history science. This way of using modern approaches in classroom should give teachers and pupils a broader picture of importance of interdisciplinary education for critical and computational thinking development through STEM and non-STEM classes that give pupils novel skills needed for future labor market.},

  abstract = {Game design environments are traditionally used as means for engaging non-programmers in the learning process. However, these environments lack specific support for teaching computational thinking to novices. Typically, such skills are acquired in ad hoc practical sessions with supervision provided by teachers or peers. The usual scenario is where a teacher guides the students in solving these problems during a game design session. In informal learning settings, step-by-step tutorials for creating existing games are used to compensate for the lack of computer support for solving design and computational problems. In this paper we suggest a game design process that combines support for computational thinking with tool usage, by identifying the most common computational thinking problems and providing a generic solution to them. We have evaluated our solution in the context of AgentWeb, an online cloud-based game design environment for novices. We discuss how to incorporate suggested computational thinking solutions as computer assistant into the game design user interface.},

Therefore, in this research, we try to use conceptual mapping so that students can construct knowledge when composing their own images, as the focus of this learning model and computational thinking is the thinking process and the two coincide. This research intends to introduce the traditional programming robot course into conceptual mapping and measure whether there are differences in computational thinking tendencies, problem-solving tendencies, and intrinsic motivations between students who use conceptual mapping and those who do not use it.

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is a key competency with a significant impact on students' academic performance in STEM fields. It empowers students to enhance problem-solving skills by decomposing problems, utilizing abstraction and pattern recognition, and employing algorithmic thinking to design solutions and build models. This is particularly important in STEM disciplines where logical reasoning is essential for addressing complex real-world challenges in academic and industrial settings. Given the increasing demand for professionals equipped with strong algorithmic thinking and problem-solving abilities in Industry 5, educational institutions are focusing on enhancing students' CT and problem-solving skills. This study presents an initiative conducted over the past two years at our institute to teach CT in a gateway course to students with different backgrounds in STEM fields. The approach involved designing specific learning modules on Abstraction, Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, and Algorithmic Thinking and integrating them into the LMS. After studying these learning modules, the students were exposed to specific assignments that required the application of related CT skills. Pre and post surveys were employed by using standard CT tests to measure the impact of the intervention on students' CT levels. The results indicated an improvement in students' perceptions of their mastery of CT. Academic course grades also showed an improvement, with increased A scores and reduced F grades post-intervention. This two-year study on improving CT skills has yielded promising results. Moving forward, the research aims to enhance the existing modules further and distribute them to a broader range of introductory-level STEM courses in other universities. This future direction aligns with the goal of expanding the impact of CT education and integrating it more widely into STEM curricula.},

Computational thinking is essentially a view of systematic information processing process. In essence, developing the computational thinking of middle school students is to improve their problem-solving ability and the corresponding practical accomplishment. The instructional activity design based on six links of problem solving can well meet the need of cultivating students’ computational thinking. The instructional mode of systematic problem solving in middle school can improve students’ learning effects and satisfaction, and promote students’ computational thinking ability significantly. The method of systematic information processing process can be trained.},

This study suggest a hamburger flowchart as a teaching material that combines the three elements of "unplugged", "thinking from the end " and "mathematics class". Using this flowchart, basic experiment was conducted for 8 to 12 years old. The purpose of this experiment is to confirm whether it is possible for children to develop both Computational thinking and Mathematical thinking by using the hamburger flowchart. We evaluated both Computational thinking and Mathematical thinking from the state in this class and the content of the worksheet and prior and subsequent tests. As a result, the state related to Computational thinking and Mathematical thinking increased, and the correct answer rate of many children increased from the prior test to the subsequent test. Therefore it turned out that the hamburger flowchart affects mathematical thinking.},

  abstract = {A significant aspect of computational thinking is as a way of reasoning about the world in terms of data. This mindset channels number-crunching toward an ambition to discover knowledge through logic, models and simulations. Here we show how computational cognitive science can be used to reconstruct and analyse the structure of computational thinking mindsets (forma mentis in Latin) through complex networks. As a case study, we investigate cognitive networks tied to key concepts of computational thinking provided by (i) 159 high school students enrolled in a science curriculum and (ii) 59 researchers in complex systems and simulations. Researchers' reconstructed knowledge highlighted a positive mindset about scientific modelling, semantically framing data and simulations as ways of discovering nature. Students correctly identified different aspects of logic reasoning but perceived ‘computation’ as a distressing, anxiety-eliciting task, framed with math jargon and lacking links to real-world discovery. Students' mindsets around ‘data’, ‘model’ and ‘simulations’ critically revealed no awareness of numerical modelling as a way for understanding the world. Our findings provide evidence of a crippled computational thinking mindset in students, who acquire mathematical skills that are not channelled toward real-world discovery through coding. This unlinked knowledge ends up being perceived as distressing number-crunching expertise with no relevant outcome. The virtuous mindset of researchers reported here indicates that computational thinking can be restored by training students specifically in coding, modelling and simulations in relation to discovering nature. Our approach opens innovative ways for quantifying computational thinking and enhancing its development through mindset reconstruction.},

  abstract = {The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT into educational contexts is reshaping the landscape of student learning and critical thinking. This study investigates the influence of ChatGPT on the critical thinking abilities of university students by enhancing computational strategies for analysis. We developed an advanced computational framework that leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to evaluate the interaction between students and ChatGPT. Our approach involves the collection and analysis of large-scale interaction data to identify patterns and impacts on critical thinking development. We employed sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and argumentation mining to decode the nature of student responses and their evolution over time. The results reveal significant improvements in critical thinking skills among students who actively engage with ChatGPT, suggesting that the AI can act as a catalyst for developing higher-order thinking skills. This study contributes to the growing body of research on AI in education by providing insights into the mechanisms through which AI tools can enhance critical thinking, and proposes practical implications for integrating such tools into academic curricula. The findings support the notion that computational analysis can provide a nuanced understanding of AI’s educational impacts, paving the way for more effective AI-assisted learning environments.},

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) has been described as a set of valuable skills for tackling complex problems. To foster CT among K-12 students, different initiatives have been introduced by governmental and non-governmental entities, and numerous studies have been carried out by researchers to define and integrate CT into school curriculum. However, previous studies has shown little agreement among researchers, governmental and non-governmental sectors about a unified CT definition. These dissensions have introduced challenges in formulating a definition for CT at the K-12 level. The absence of a unified definition may increase the challenges for teachers to teach and integrate CT into school curriculum. To foster CT among K-12 students, we introduce a definition and framework for CT. We evaluated 39 articles and extracted the most common elements used in the literature to frame CT definition and describe its elements. Several studies have discussed, as well as investigated, the significance of conceptualizing and comprehending the interaction and dependency relationships among computational objects. However, our literature review discovered that little attention has been dedicated to the concept of dependency in the CT body of knowledge. Based on the literature review, we define CT as the thought process used for solving problems, and it encompasses the elements of problem decomposition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking. We conjecture the CT definition is missing the element of dependency. In the context of CT, we define dependency as the knowledge of comprehending the interrelationships between different sections of a decomposed problem.},

As information technology advances rapidly, effectively integrating advanced teaching models to enhance students' engineering literacy and computational thinking has become a key focus in educational reform. This study examines the effects of the DMCT-CDIO dual-mainline computational thinking-integrated engineering education model on students' computational thinking, motivation, engagement, and cognitive load. Conducted in a data mining course at a teacher training university in China, the study involved 76 second-year undergraduates. The experimental group (n=38) followed the DMCT-CDIO model, while the control group (n=38) implemented the traditional CDIO model. ANOVA results indicated that the experimental group demonstrated significant improvements in intrinsic motivation, behavioral engagement, emotional engagement, and computational thinking (including algorithmic thinking, critical thinking, and problem-solving ability), outperforming the control group. Additionally, the experimental group exhibited significantly lower cognitive load. These findings offer valuable insights for educators and researchers, suggesting future research directions, such as further integrating the DMCT-CDIO model with engineering learning, exploring the relationship between psychological variables and academic performance, and analyzing the cognitive development of computational thinking and engineering practice behaviors among diverse student groups. These efforts aim to optimize instructional design based on empirical data.},

  abstract = {This work-in-progress research-to-practice paper presents an intervention on integrating computational thinking modules into a software engineering course. The national consensus on the significance of computational thinking has prompted the expansion of related educational initiatives over the past decade. Since the definition of computational thinking by Wing in 2006, this concept has gained significant attention within the educational community. Particularly this surge of interest has led to extensive research into its conceptual foundations and subsequent integration into educational curricula since 2013. National initiatives have since emerged to incorporate computational thinking into the educational system. Furthermore, as artificial intelligence and computing systems become increasingly integrated into daily life, there is a growing demand from industries for a workforce and graduates adept at critical thinking and problem-solving. Aligned with this national movement, our study presents a two-year institutional initiative, aimed at integrating computational thinking into the software engineering program. The software engineering discipline extensively involves design thinking and problem-solving skills. However, we noticed that these higher-level skills are not imparted early in the program to teach students this method of thinking and approaching problems. To bridge this skill gap, we developed a set of computational thinking modules and integrated them into a gateway course in the software engineering program. Over two years, we implemented this intervention in an introductory-level course and evaluated its impact on students' computational thinking skills by analyzing their responses to a standard Computational Thinking Assessment survey. The results showed significant improvement in most components. These early findings underscore the effectiveness of integrating these computational thinking modules into the gateway courses, regardless of the specific course topic. A notable feature of these modules is their adaptability to diverse engineering courses, suggesting broader applicability across disciplines. Moving forward, our research aims to expand the integration of the computational thinking modules into various courses in other institutes across the nation and analyze their impact on student performance.},

One such skill is computational thinking (CT), which will help to solve problems algorithmically using computers. Computational thinking will improve their problem solving skills in a non-conventional manner as this leads the student to think in multiple paths to reach the solution. However, it is a challenge in Computing Education to develop student's ability to solve problems in an algorithmic way. The aim of this paper is to introduce a potential and pragmatic approach to develop computational thinking skills in novices.},

  abstract = {This research study presents our work focused on studying the development of introductory computational thinking in undergraduate biomedical engineering students. In response to the growing computational intensity of the healthcare industry, biomedical engineering (BME) undergraduate education is starting to emphasize computation and computational thinking. Computational thinking is a way of thinking that uses concepts and methodologies of computing to solve problems in interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary subjects. In broader terms, computational thinking is not only associated with using computational tools but also with the thought process of solving a problem by data representation, problem decomposition, and algorithm design. Despite being so important, there is little research work or information available on the development of computational thinking in BME undergraduate students. Our research focuses on how BME undergraduate students develop computational thinking skills while performing group activities related to problem-solving. In order to conduct this study, we incorporate a teaching methodology that prompts computational thinking in a thermodynamics course being taught at a public mid-western university to approximately 120 sophomore students. We observe classroom activities involving analytical problem solving followed by pseudo code generation for computational coding. In order to investigate computational thinking, we collect classroom observations of small groups of students as they come up with a solution to an analytical problem with each other. We complement the observation notes of the classroom activities with follow up semi structured interviews with individual students from five groups. Thematic analysis of the student interviews is used in order to analyze student responses towards the incorporation of computation intensive teaching methodology. This Work in Progress helps us expand our understanding of computational thinking development and the challenges involved in performing computational thinking activity in BME undergraduate students.},

The model blends six critical types of thinking, i.e., logical thinking, systems thinking, sustainable thinking, strategic thinking, creative thinking, and responsible thinking into the design of a first-year undergraduate programming course. The study describes a creative blended pedagogy that embeds the proposed model into the course plan.Background: The emergence of artificial intelligent systems such as large language models from a knowledge provider perspective, coupled with a gradual change in post-pandemic outlook of education challenge the relevance and raises concerns about the future of education. The 21st-century human CT requirements, viz., learning to code (skill) and thinking computationally (competency), will be inadequate in the future. Moreover, there is substantial evidence which shows that most introductory programming courses fail to integrate critical elements like ethics and responsibility as part of the course.Intended Outcomes: The authors anticipate experiential learning models such as this has immense potential to future-proof CS education, as well as make future software engineers responsible citizens.Application Design: The proposed model blends six types of thinking into the design and activities of the course. The underlying theoretical basis of these activities revolve around three key principles: 1) experiential learning; 2) self-reflection; and 3) peer learning.Findings: This case study from a liberal educational institution in India qualitatively shows evidence of students developing six critical elements of thinking that shapes their future CT ability.},

Challenges to the development of computational thinking in junior high school students include a single teaching method, teachers’ overemphasis on programming language learning, a lack of systematic teaching content, and students’ lack of problem-solving skills, which affect the development of computational thinking. Based on this, this study takes ninth-grade students as the research object, and adopts Quasi-experimental and Survey research methods under the guidance of constructivism theory, theory of mind and learning community theory to construct and validate a PBL teaching mode based on the cultivation of computational thinking in junior high school information technology curriculum. The results show that the PBL teaching mode for computational thinking cultivation is applied to the junior high school Mixly course to improve the computational thinking level of students. This study provides theoretical reference and practical significance for Mixly teaching oriented towards CT cultivation.},

  abstract = {In today's world of growing complexity and interconnectedness, computational thinking (CT) and systems thinking (ST) are imperative for everyone to solve complex problems, create advanced solutions, and innovate cutting-edge technologies and systems. Traditional teaching approaches for CT and ST offer limited avenues for applying the knowledge and skills learned in class. This paper presents and discusses the design and development of intelligent aquaponics capstone projects to foster CT and ST in undergraduate students. Specifically, students designed and built an automated aquaponics system with internet of things for real-time remote monitoring and control. Aquaculture and hydroponics subsystems, hardware and software components, communication networks, and data acquisition and analysis of fish and plant growth were integrated and tested, with high yield and quality of fish and vegetables. Attributable to the multidisciplinary and multifaceted high-tech aquaponics system, students can broaden and deepen their theoretical understanding and practical experience of CT and ST.},

  abstract = {To better understand the impact of students' personality on their computational thinking (CT), this paper develops a CT evaluation tool for college students. Correlation analysis is used to explore the relationship between students' computational thinking skills (CTS) and their five personality traits: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness. 219 college students completed the CT Assessment Test and the Big Five Personality Inventory. The results showed that there were statistically significant correlations between CTS and extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness, among which openness had the greatest impact on CTS, and extraversion and conscientiousness had moderate effects on CTS. These results are consistent with the conclusions of most related literatures, confirming the existence of non-cognitive influencing factors of CT. Based on these findings, this paper recommends that teachers can pay attention to the individual differences of students from the perspective of personality, and provide them with suitable education to comprehensively improve students' CTS.},

Therefore, how to effectively improve girls' CT has become a serious concern. This study integrated two types of project-based learning (PBL) into a Scratch programming course, one with extensive teacher-supported scaffolding and the other with limited teacher-supported scaffolding. To examine their impact on girls' CT skills and self-efficacy, this study applied mixed research methods, conducted a pretest-posttest control group experiment, and analyzed the quantitative and qualitative data collected from 21 grade-3 girls in a primary school. It was found that the extensive teacher-supported scaffolding of PBL in a Scratch programming course is more effective in promoting the CT skills and self-efficacy than limited teacher-supported scaffolding of PBL. These findings have some implications for the effective PBL practice and related teacher professional development.},

  abstract = {During training at the Complementary Formation Program (CFP), Colombian primary school teachers do not acquire Computational Thinking (CT) skills, which are considered fundamental for the knowledge economies of the 21st century. In this paper, we describe the early stages of a project aiming to reform the CFP curriculum, such that CT skills becomes an integral part. As a first step, we carried-out four introductory workshops with 64 first-and third-semester CFP students and then surveyed them to gather their perceptions on CT. The results show that the students have a limited understanding of CT and its associated skills, but they recognize their importance. Moreover, they agree that primary school should be the starting point to develop them. The project will continue gathering information from current CFP teachers, current primary school teachers, and university professors who are experts in curriculum development, to develop the curricular proposal.},

Computer science, information systems, computer engineering, informatics, software engineering-these are among the smorgasbord of choices available to college students interested in a computing career. The choices for noncomputing-oriented students who want to learn about the field are even more confounding. Indeed, the established term "computer science" is not well-defined or well understood, leading to further confusion for students and their parents as well as the general public. These are some factors I view as contributing to the drop in interest in the study of computer science. The student should learn the fundamental concept of computer sciences. Computing education has been too slow moving from the computing = programming model to a more general and understandable model that captures the essence of the discipline for everyone.},

  abstract = {Learning to program is the new literacy of the 21st century. Computational thinking, closely related to programming, requires thinking and solving problems with different levels of abstraction and is independent of hardware devices. The early childhood education stage provides teachers with the opportunity to lay the foundations for a comprehensive quality education using innovative tools and technologies. Educational robotics in early childhood education becomes a tool that facilitates the acquisition of knowledge to children, playfully, based on the principles of interactivity, social interrelationships, collaborative work, creativity, constructivist and constructionist learning, and a student-centered didactic approach, allowing in turn that student can acquire digital competencies and develop logical and computational thinking in an underlying way. This project explores the current state of teaching and learning computational thinking and programming in early childhood education in an inclusive manner. Moreover, the lack of diversity and inequality is particularly latent in science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. Therefore, this work considers this problem and presents an inclusive coeducation approach to this new literacy, eliminating gender stereotypes and extending them to people with Down syndrome and hospitalized minors.},

The integral role that Computational Thinking modalities play in engineering disciplines can serve as an accurate indicator of the student future academic success. Therefore, this study investigated the students' performance in a Computational Thinking course offered at the freshman level to predict student academic success. To achieve this goal, a two-year study of the correlation between the students' accumulative grade point averages and their grades obtained in this course was conducted. The performance of nine hundred and eighty two students in forty sections was assessed over the two-year period. It was concluded that the students' future academic performance is strongly correlated to their Computational Thinking skills assessed at the freshman level. This clearly suggests the viability of using Computational Thinking skills as a fairly accurate predictor of students' academic success. These results have also implied that the assessment of Computational Thinking can be used as an early intervention tool to improve the students' retention, progression, and graduation rates in STEM related disciplines.},

In this paper, the experience of using block-based programming environments such as Scratch, Lightbot and the PSelnt pseudo-code tool for the understanding of computational concepts and development of computational thinking skills is reported. A quasi-experimental methodological design was used, since it did not work with a control group. A mixed exploratory investigation was carried out. 85 first-year students from the Accounting Professional School of the National University of San Agustin de Arequipa participated in the experience. The results show that in introductory programming courses of short time period, teaching with block-based programming environments compared to the use of pseudocode with the PSelnt tool, facilitates the appropriation of computational concepts and the development of computational thinking skills; thus obtaining better learning results. It is concluded that block-based programming environments favor the construction of knowledge and foster the development of creativity and algorithmic thinking.},

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) skills are becoming increasingly relevant for future professionals across all domains, beyond computer science (CS). As such, an increasing number of bachelor's and master's programs outside of the CS discipline integrate CT courses within their study program. At the same time, tools such as notebooks and interactive apps designed to support the teaching of programming concepts are becoming ever more popular. However, in non-CS majors, CT might not be perceived as essential, and students might lack the motivation to engage with such tools in order to acquire solid CT skills. This article presents a field study conducted with 115 students during a full semester on a novel computational notebook environment. It evaluates computational notebooks and CT skills in an introductory course on information technology for first-year undergraduates in business and economics. A multidimensional evaluation approach makes use of pre- and post-test surveys, lectures, and self-directed laboratory sessions tracking analytics. Our findings suggest that, in the process of learning CT for non-CS students, engagement in active learning activities can be a stronger determinant of learning outcomes than initial knowledge. Furthermore, gamifying computational notebooks can serve as a strong driver of active learning engagement, even more so than initial motivational factors.},

  abstract = {This paper examines how computational thinking and engineering design can be integrated into STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) education through a hands-on lesson focused on logistics and its societal impact. In this activity, middle school students program Ozobots (mini-robots used to teach coding) to model delivery routes for Amazon.com packages, a task that mirrors real-world challenges. The students combine coding skills with real-world problem-solving, gaining practical experiences that will serve them well in the future. Students will focus on the logistics when they create and refine delivery paths using block-based coding while tackling challenges like traffic patterns, delivery priorities, and route efficiency. The lesson encourages creativity, logical thinking, and collaboration while introducing key concepts in robotics, logistics, and computational thinking. Additionally, students critically analyze the societal implications of logistics systems by comparing synthetic and natural materials, with a focus on sustainability and ethical considerations. Societal influences further connect to the impacts of computing standards in a way that relates how individuals and communities affect computing by how they behave, interact culturally, and engage socially. This approach enhances STEM literacy and cultivates a deeper understanding of the interplay between technology, logistics, and societal needs. It is also an interdisciplinary lesson addressing science, computer science, engineering, and mathematics standards. By integrating science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, students can see the real-world connections between these subjects, encouraging a deeper understanding and preparing them for the complex challenges of the future. These lessons enhance their academic growth and inspire creativity and collaboration, essential skills for success in the rapidly evolving world.},

  abstract = {Computational thinking is a crucial skill for students to analyze and solve problems, and programming education serves as an important pathway to cultivate computational thinking. This study combines relevant literature and utilizes Scratch, a visual programming software, to construct a gamified teaching model for Scratch courses. A quasi-experimental research design was employed, involving two fifth-grade classes from a primary school in K city. The study employed methods such as analysis of student works, SPSS scale data analysis, and student interviews to investigate the impact of gamified teaching in Scratch courses on developing elementary students' computational thinking. The results indicate that gamified teaching in Scratch courses significantly enhances the computational thinking level of elementary students, particularly in the dimensions of critical thinking, problem-solving ability, and algorithmic thinking. Based on the research findings, it is recommended that gamified teaching in Scratch courses should involve appropriate teaching tools, incorporate game-based learning, emphasize problem-solving, encourage collaborative learning, and provide training for educators competent in programming education.},

Participants were enrolled in the basic computer course from two classes at a university in central China. One class as an experimental group was chosen for the flipped-classroom instruction method (n=55); the other as a control group used the traditional lecture-based instruction method (n=54). The results show that learning through the flipped-classroom approach can significantly promote students’ levels of creativity, algorithmic thinking, cooperativity, and critical thinking, compared with the traditional lecture-based instruction approach. The findings of this research suggest that instructors should be encouraged to take the flipped-classroom instruction method to teach.},

The structure of a programming language does not cause impose problems to students, the real obstacle is how to apply these learned grammars and present them in a complete and correct program code for problem solving. In this study, a deep learning recommendation system was developed, which includes augmented reality (AR) technology, and learning theory, and is provided for study by students in non-major and also from different learning backgrounds. Those students divided into two groups, the students participating in the experimental group were using the AR system with deep learning recommendation and the students participating in the control group were using the AR system without deep learning recommendation. The results show that students in experimental group perform better than the control group with regards to learning achievement. On the other hand, in the part of computational thinking ability, students using a deep learning recommendation based AR system is significantly better than those using non-deep learning recommendation based AR system. Among the various dimensions of computational thinking, creativity, logical computing, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills are significantly different among the two groups of students. The students in experimental group perform better than the control group with regards to the dimensions of computational thinking, creativity, logical computing, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills.},

  abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) is a method of analysis and problem solving that enables the development of life skills and positively influences the social and competitive conditions of people. This type of thinking promotes learning through the application of planning, analysis, abstraction and decomposition of problems into their constituent parts. In addition, PC contributes to the formation of critical thinking, creativity and cooperation between people. In education, the mechanisms used to foster CP are diverse; among them, learning through programming. Databases of source code generated in learning exercises using the CP method are a valuable tool for discovering learning patterns. However, there are no robust and scalable methods for studying the huge source code bases of learning products to recognize the predominant patterns and determine the effectiveness of the method. Consequently, a comprehensive analysis of learners’ skills, knowledge, outcomes and performance levels is necessary to identify points of improvement to meet learning objectives and modify curricula and exercises. This paper presents the joint research between the Costa Rica Institute of Technology (TEC) and the PRONIE MEP-FOD program of the Omar Dengo Foundation. Its objective is to automatically analyze the source code created by the students, evaluate the Computational Thinking skills they developed and compare the results with the learning objectives established in the study plans.},

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) gained significant importance in education, leading to a surge in the development of dedicated instructional platforms. The cultivation of students’ CT skills posed a challenge, often involving the introduction of abstract and challenging-to-visualize programming concepts. This study aimed to bridge this gap by introducing an augmented reality-based coding game—an interactive learning platform designed to facilitate students in acquiring programming skills and enhancing their grasp of computational thinking concepts. The augmented reality (AR) digital game is specifically directed towards fundamental CT skills, such as pattern recognition, decomposition, abstraction, and developing algorithms. To evaluate the effectiveness of the AR game in enhancing CT skills, a study was conducted with 124 middle school students, entailing in grades 6th and 8th. The experimental group (N = 63) utilized the AR game, while the control group (N = 61) relied on conventional text materials. The findings of the experiment strongly supported the integration of AR technology along with game-based learning as a means to enhance CT knowledge and skills while simultaneously reducing cognitive load.},

Game-based learning has recently seen an increase in prevalence for teaching computational thinking, making games an important topic of study. However, there is currently no validated tool for assessing Computational Thinking (CT) that performs reliably across disciplines and age groups. In the absence of such a tool, this paper examines several software testing methods for the evaluation of CT pedagogy effectiveness within serious games. Namely, it makes recommendations for the application of standardized questionnaires, think-aloud testing, and automated data logging for evaluating games that promote CT learning. It concludes with a potential use case to demonstrate how the methods can be combined to achieve a granular and actionable understanding of a complex CT assessment problem and its causes.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to design a computational thinking curriculum standard for K-12 education. The Delphi technique was employed to collect different views and derive consensus from a panel of thirteen experts, including computer scientists, computer science educators, K-12 computer teachers, and industry experts. The first draft of Delphi survey questionnaire, consisting of nine themes (problem solving, problem decomposition, algorithms, data representation, data analysis, modeling and simulation, abstraction, automation, and others) and 60 competence indicators, was developed based on our investigation of the nature of computational thinking. After three rounds of survey and a final round-table discussion, the expert panel derived 49 essential competence indicators (13 for grades K to 6, nine for grades 7 to 9 and 27 of grades 10 to 12) and eight optional competence indicators (one for grades 7 to 9 and seven for grades 10 to 12). According to the results, the core ability and training of computational thinking are different in grades. In grades K to 6, students develop logical thinking and problem solving skills in personal and family life. In grades 7 to 9, students must understand the basic concepts of programming and write basic programs. Finally, in grades 10 to 12, they will use high-level skills to apply the concepts of abstraction, modeling, and structured problem decomposition to solve problems in different fields. The results serve as useful references for developing Taiwan's new K-12 computing curriculum.},

However, the existing computational thinking assessments still suffer from the problem of insufficient examination of non-cognitive factors, leading to the lack of validity of its assessment results. Since the iceberg model can comprehensively and deeply explore individual characteristics, this paper draws on the division idea of the model and divides computational thinking into explicit computational thinking the basic knowledge required to solve problems using computational thinking and implicit computational thinking the internal psychological characteristics of individuals in the process of using computational thinking. A comprehensive assessment framework of computational thinking is constructed, which contains five dimensions: knowledge and skills, self-efficacy, internet attitude, learning motivation, and thinking style. Finally, its application in the hierarchical teaching of computational thinking and suggestions for personalized teaching programs are given in order to promote the development of personalized education in computational thinking.},

Our innovative NSF-funded IC2Think project blends computational thinking with creative thinking so that students leverage their creative thinking skills to “unlock” their understanding of computational thinking. In Fall 2012, we deployed creative exercises designed to engage Epstein's creative competencies (Surrounding, Capturing, Challenging and Broadening) in introductory level CS courses targeting four different groups (CS, engineering, combined CS/physical sciences, and humanities majors). Students combined hands-on problem solving with guided analysis and reflection to connect their creative activities to CS topics such as conditionals and arrays and to real-world CS applications. Evaluation results (approximately 150 students) found that creative thinking exercise completion had a linear “dosage” effect. As students completed more exercises [0/1 – 4], they increased their long-term retention [a computational thinking test], F(3, 98) = 4.76, p =.004, partial Eta2 = .127 and course grades, F(3, 109) = 4.32, p =.006, partial Eta2 = .106. These findings support our belief that the addition of creative thinking exercises to CSCE courses improves the learning of computational knowledge and skills.},

Although many examples exist for using critical and computational thinking in STEM educational area, the social sciences i.e., non-STEM areas were somehow left out due to the relatively more difficult design of such content, especially in the part of the development of computational thinking. In that context, in this paper we present one way of using critical and computational thinking in non-STEM education, more specifically on the example of historical data sources, through the use of programming in Python. As an example, we use historical data for Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade routes, that were the largest long-distance coerced movement of people in history up to the mid-nineteenth century, for connecting concepts of databases, Data Science and programming for development of critical and computational thinking in context of history science. This way of using modern approaches in classroom should give teachers and pupils a broader picture of importance of interdisciplinary education for critical and computational thinking development through STEM and non-STEM classes that give pupils novel skills needed for future labor market.},

  abstract = {Game design environments are traditionally used as means for engaging non-programmers in the learning process. However, these environments lack specific support for teaching computational thinking to novices. Typically, such skills are acquired in ad hoc practical sessions with supervision provided by teachers or peers. The usual scenario is where a teacher guides the students in solving these problems during a game design session. In informal learning settings, step-by-step tutorials for creating existing games are used to compensate for the lack of computer support for solving design and computational problems. In this paper we suggest a game design process that combines support for computational thinking with tool usage, by identifying the most common computational thinking problems and providing a generic solution to them. We have evaluated our solution in the context of AgentWeb, an online cloud-based game design environment for novices. We discuss how to incorporate suggested computational thinking solutions as computer assistant into the game design user interface.},

Therefore, in this research, we try to use conceptual mapping so that students can construct knowledge when composing their own images, as the focus of this learning model and computational thinking is the thinking process and the two coincide. This research intends to introduce the traditional programming robot course into conceptual mapping and measure whether there are differences in computational thinking tendencies, problem-solving tendencies, and intrinsic motivations between students who use conceptual mapping and those who do not use it. The students in the experimental group with conceptual mapping activities developed computational thinking skills during the program robotics course.

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is a key competency with a significant impact on students' academic performance in STEM fields. It empowers students to enhance problem-solving skills by decomposing problems, utilizing abstraction and pattern recognition, and employing algorithmic thinking to design solutions and build models. This is particularly important in STEM disciplines where logical reasoning is essential for addressing complex real-world challenges in academic and industrial settings. Given the increasing demand for professionals equipped with strong algorithmic thinking and problem-solving abilities in Industry 5, educational institutions are focusing on enhancing students' CT and problem-solving skills. This study presents an initiative conducted over the past two years at our institute to teach CT in a gateway course to students with different backgrounds in STEM fields. The approach involved designing specific learning modules on Abstraction, Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, and Algorithmic Thinking and integrating them into the LMS. After studying these learning modules, the students were exposed to specific assignments that required the application of related CT skills. Pre and post surveys were employed by using standard CT tests to measure the impact of the intervention on students' CT levels. The results indicated an improvement in students' perceptions of their mastery of CT. Academic course grades also showed an improvement, with increased A scores and reduced F grades post-intervention. This two-year study on improving CT skills has yielded promising results. Moving forward, the research aims to enhance the existing modules further and distribute them to a broader range of introductory-level STEM courses in other universities. This future direction aligns with the goal of expanding the impact of CT education and integrating it more widely into STEM curricula.},

This mindset channels number-crunching toward an ambition to discover knowledge through logic, models and simulations. Here we show how computational cognitive science can be used to reconstruct and analyse the structure of computational thinking mindsets (forma mentis in Latin) through complex networks. As a case study, we investigate cognitive networks tied to key concepts of computational thinking provided by (i) 159 high school students enrolled in a science curriculum and (ii) 59 researchers in complex systems and simulations. Researchers' reconstructed knowledge highlighted a positive mindset about scientific modelling, semantically framing data and simulations as ways of discovering nature. Students correctly identified different aspects of logic reasoning but perceived ‘computation’ as a distressing, anxiety-eliciting task, framed with math jargon and lacking links to real-world discovery. Students' mindsets around ‘data’, ‘model’ and ‘simulations’ critically revealed no awareness of numerical modelling as a way for understanding the world. Our findings provide evidence of a crippled computational thinking mindset in students, who acquire mathematical skills that are not channelled toward real-world discovery through coding. This unlinked knowledge ends up being perceived as distressing number-crunching expertise with no relevant outcome. The virtuous mindset of researchers reported here indicates that computational thinking can be restored by training students specifically in coding, modelling and simulations in relation to discovering nature. Our approach opens innovative ways for quantifying computational thinking and enhancing its development through mindset reconstruction.},

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) has been described as a set of valuable skills for tackling complex problems. To foster CT among K-12 students, different initiatives have been introduced by governmental and non-governmental entities, and numerous studies have been carried out by researchers to define and integrate CT into school curriculum. However, previous studies has shown little agreement among researchers, governmental and non-governmental sectors about a unified CT definition. These dissensions have introduced challenges in formulating a definition for CT at the K-12 level. The absence of a unified definition may increase the challenges for teachers to teach and integrate CT into school curriculum. To foster CT among K-12 students, we introduce a definition and framework for CT. We evaluated 39 articles and extracted the most common elements used in the literature to frame CT definition and describe its elements. Several studies have discussed, as well as investigated, the significance of conceptualizing and comprehending the interaction and dependency relationships among computational objects. However, our literature review discovered that little attention has been dedicated to the concept of dependency in the CT body of knowledge. Based on the literature review, we define CT as the thought process used for solving problems, and it encompasses the elements of problem decomposition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking. We conjecture the CT definition is missing the element of dependency. In the context of CT, we define dependency as the knowledge of comprehending the interrelationships between different sections of a decomposed problem.},

The tools include a wide array of interactive learning environments or cognitive mini-tutors; most important among them is the Carnegie Proof Lab. The Proof Lab is a sophisticated interface for constructing natural deduction proofs and is central, as strategically guided discovery of proofs is the distinctive focus of the course. My discussion makes explicit the broader intellectual context, but also the pursuit of pedagogical goals and their experimental examination. The intellectual context includes i) the theoretical background for the proof search algorithm AProS and its use for a dynamic Proof Tutor, and ii) the programmatic expansion of the course to Computational Logic. (I recommend that the reader enter the virtual classroom of Logic & Proofs: the interactive components just cannot be properly reflected in a narrative. It is also very easy to download AProS and observe its ways of searching for proofs.) 1},

As information technology advances rapidly, effectively integrating advanced teaching models to enhance students' engineering literacy and computational thinking has become a key focus in educational reform. This study examines the effects of the DMCT-CDIO dual-mainline computational thinking-integrated engineering education model on students' computational thinking, motivation, engagement, and cognitive load. Conducted in a data mining course at a teacher training university in China, the study involved 76 second-year undergraduates. The experimental group (n=38) followed the DMCT-CDIO model, while the control group (n=38) implemented the traditional CDIO model. ANOVA results indicated that the experimental group demonstrated significant improvements in intrinsic motivation, behavioral engagement, emotional engagement, and computational thinking (including algorithmic thinking, critical thinking, and problem-solving ability), outperforming the control group. Additionally, the experimental group exhibited significantly lower cognitive load. These findings offer valuable insights for educators and researchers, suggesting future research directions, such as further integrating the DMCT-CDIO model with engineering learning, exploring the relationship between psychological variables and academic performance, and analyzing the cognitive development of computational thinking and engineering practice behaviors among diverse student groups. These efforts aim to optimize instructional design based on empirical data.},

  abstract = {This work-in-progress research-to-practice paper presents an intervention on integrating computational thinking modules into a software engineering course. The national consensus on the significance of computational thinking has prompted the expansion of related educational initiatives over the past decade. Since the definition of computational thinking by Wing in 2006, this concept has gained significant attention within the educational community. Particularly this surge of interest has led to extensive research into its conceptual foundations and subsequent integration into educational curricula since 2013. National initiatives have since emerged to incorporate computational thinking into the educational system. Furthermore, as artificial intelligence and computing systems become increasingly integrated into daily life, there is a growing demand from industries for a workforce and graduates adept at critical thinking and problem-solving. Aligned with this national movement, our study presents a two-year institutional initiative, aimed at integrating computational thinking into the software engineering program. The software engineering discipline extensively involves design thinking and problem-solving skills. However, we noticed that these higher-level skills are not imparted early in the program to teach students this method of thinking and approaching problems. To bridge this skill gap, we developed a set of computational thinking modules and integrated them into a gateway course in the software engineering program. Over two years, we implemented this intervention in an introductory-level course and evaluated its impact on students' computational thinking skills by analyzing their responses to a standard Computational Thinking Assessment survey. The results showed significant improvement in most components. These early findings underscore the effectiveness of integrating these computational thinking modules into the gateway courses, regardless of the specific course topic. A notable feature of these modules is their adaptability to diverse engineering courses, suggesting broader applicability across disciplines. Moving forward, our research aims to expand the integration of the computational thinking modules into various courses in other institutes across the nation and analyze their impact on student performance.},

  abstract = {This research study presents our work focused on studying the development of introductory computational thinking in undergraduate biomedical engineering students. In response to the growing computational intensity of the healthcare industry, biomedical engineering (BME) undergraduate education is starting to emphasize computation and computational thinking. Computational thinking is a way of thinking that uses concepts and methodologies of computing to solve problems in interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary subjects. In broader terms, computational thinking is not only associated with using computational tools but also with the thought process of solving a problem by data representation, problem decomposition, and algorithm design. Despite being so important, there is little research work or information available on the development of computational thinking in BME undergraduate students. Our research focuses on how BME undergraduate students develop computational thinking skills while performing group activities related to problem-solving. In order to conduct this study, we incorporate a teaching methodology that prompts computational thinking in a thermodynamics course being taught at a public mid-western university to approximately 120 sophomore students. We observe classroom activities involving analytical problem solving followed by pseudo code generation for computational coding. In order to investigate computational thinking, we collect classroom observations of small groups of students as they come up with a solution to an analytical problem with each other. We complement the observation notes of the classroom activities with follow up semi structured interviews with individual students from five groups. Thematic analysis of the student interviews is used in order to analyze student responses towards the incorporation of computation intensive teaching methodology. This Work in Progress helps us expand our understanding of computational thinking development and the challenges involved in performing computational thinking activity in BME undergraduate students.},

  abstract = {Observations have shown the need of adequate collaboration among the engineering educators for effective achievement of its goals. Nevertheless, there have been reports of the inadequate relationship among engineering educators. Consequently, it is vital to develop strategies to boost the synergy among the parties. Computational Thinking (CT) could be a dependable approach. This paper presents ways of ensuring synergy among engineering educators through computational thinking. A questionnaire survey that sought information from the respondents on the ways computational thinking: promotes thinking abilities, reduces personal clashes, and improves decision-making process among the engineering educators was administered to 400 respondents. 348 survey answers were returned, found reliable and used in the data analysis. The analysis revealed that computational thinking plays vital roles in the repositioning of engineering education for solving of novel problems, assurance of mutual respect among educators, and intensive research for renown engineering education with relative contribution index above 0.8. The paper recommends the development of a computational thinking based comprehensive engineering educators' synergy framework as a suggestion for future research.},

The model blends six critical types of thinking, i.e., logical thinking, systems thinking, sustainable thinking, strategic thinking, creative thinking, and responsible thinking into the design of a first-year undergraduate programming course. The study describes a creative blended pedagogy that embeds the proposed model into the course plan.Background: The emergence of artificial intelligent systems such as large language models from a knowledge provider perspective, coupled with a gradual change in post-pandemic outlook of education challenge the relevance and raises concerns about the future of education. The 21st-century human CT requirements, viz., learning to code (skill) and thinking computationally (competency), will be inadequate in the future. Moreover, there is substantial evidence which shows that most introductory programming courses fail to integrate critical elements like ethics and responsibility as part of the course.Intended Outcomes: The authors anticipate experiential learning models such as this has immense potential to future-proof CS education, as well as make future software engineers responsible citizens.Application Design: The proposed model blends six types of thinking into the design and activities of the course. The underlying theoretical basis of these activities revolve around three key principles: 1) experiential learning; 2) self-reflection; and 3) peer learning.Findings: This case study from a liberal educational institution in India qualitatively shows evidence of students developing six critical elements of thinking that shapes their future CT ability.},

Correlation analysis is used to explore the relationship between students' computational thinking skills (CTS) and their five personality traits: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness. 219 college students completed the CT Assessment Test and the Big Five Personality Inventory. The results showed that there were statistically significant correlations between CTS and extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness, among which openness had the greatest impact on CTS, and extraversion and conscientiousness had moderate effects on CTS. These results are consistent with the conclusions of most related literatures, confirming the existence of non-cognitive influencing factors of CT. Based on these findings, this paper recommends that teachers can pay attention to the individual differences of students from the perspective of personality, and provide them with suitable education to comprehensively improve students' CTS.},

  abstract = {Learning to program is the new literacy of the 21st century. Computational thinking, closely related to programming, requires thinking and solving problems with different levels of abstraction and is independent of hardware devices. The early childhood education stage provides teachers with the opportunity to lay the foundations for a comprehensive quality education using innovative tools and technologies. Educational robotics in early childhood education becomes a tool that facilitates the acquisition of knowledge to children, playfully, based on the principles of interactivity, social interrelationships, collaborative work, creativity, constructivist and constructionist learning, and a student-centered didactic approach, allowing in turn that student can acquire digital competencies and develop logical and computational thinking in an underlying way. This project explores the current state of teaching and learning computational thinking and programming in early childhood education in an inclusive manner. Moreover, the lack of diversity and inequality is particularly latent in science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. Therefore, this work considers this problem and presents an inclusive coeducation approach to this new literacy, eliminating gender stereotypes and extending them to people with Down syndrome and hospitalized minors.},

The integral role that Computational Thinking modalities play in engineering disciplines can serve as an accurate indicator of the student future academic success. Therefore, this study investigated the students' performance in a Computational Thinking course offered at the freshman level to predict student academic success. To achieve this goal, a two-year study of the correlation between the students' accumulative grade point averages and their grades obtained in this course was conducted. The performance of nine hundred and eighty two students in forty sections was assessed over the two-year period. It was concluded that the students' future academic performance is strongly correlated to their Computational Thinking skills assessed at the freshman level. This clearly suggests the viability of using Computational Thinking skills as a fairly accurate predictor of students' academic success. These results have also implied that the assessment of Computational Thinking can be used as an early intervention tool to improve the students' retention, progression, and graduation rates in STEM related disciplines.},

In this paper, the experience of using block-based programming environments such as Scratch, Lightbot and the PSelnt pseudo-code tool for the understanding of computational concepts and development of computational thinking skills is reported. A quasi-experimental methodological design was used, since it did not work with a control group. A mixed exploratory investigation was carried out. 85 first-year students from the Accounting Professional School of the National University of San Agustin de Arequipa participated in the experience. The results show that in introductory programming courses of short time period, teaching with block-based programming environments compared to the use of pseudocode with the PSelnt tool, facilitates the appropriation of computational concepts and the development of computational thinking skills; thus obtaining better learning results. It is concluded that block-based programming environments favor the construction of knowledge and foster the development of creativity and algorithmic thinking.},

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) skills are becoming increasingly relevant for future professionals across all domains, beyond computer science (CS). As such, an increasing number of bachelor's and master's programs outside of the CS discipline integrate CT courses within their study program. At the same time, tools such as notebooks and interactive apps designed to support the teaching of programming concepts are becoming ever more popular. However, in non-CS majors, CT might not be perceived as essential, and students might lack the motivation to engage with such tools in order to acquire solid CT skills. This article presents a field study conducted with 115 students during a full semester on a novel computational notebook environment. It evaluates computational notebooks and CT skills in an introductory course on information technology for first-year undergraduates in business and economics. A multidimensional evaluation approach makes use of pre- and post-test surveys, lectures, and self-directed laboratory sessions tracking analytics. Our findings suggest that, in the process of learning CT for non-CS students, engagement in active learning activities can be a stronger determinant of learning outcomes than initial knowledge. Furthermore, gamifying computational notebooks can serve as a strong driver of active learning engagement, even more so than initial motivational factors.},

  abstract = {This paper examines how computational thinking and engineering design can be integrated into STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) education through a hands-on lesson focused on logistics and its societal impact. In this activity, middle school students program Ozobots (mini-robots used to teach coding) to model delivery routes for Amazon.com packages, a task that mirrors real-world challenges. The students combine coding skills with real-world problem-solving, gaining practical experiences that will serve them well in the future. Students will focus on the logistics when they create and refine delivery paths using block-based coding while tackling challenges like traffic patterns, delivery priorities, and route efficiency. The lesson encourages creativity, logical thinking, and collaboration while introducing key concepts in robotics, logistics, and computational thinking. Additionally, students critically analyze the societal implications of logistics systems by comparing synthetic and natural materials, with a focus on sustainability and ethical considerations. Societal influences further connect to the impacts of computing standards in a way that relates how individuals and communities affect computing by how they behave, interact culturally, and engage socially. This approach enhances STEM literacy and cultivates a deeper understanding of the interplay between technology, logistics, and societal needs. It is also an interdisciplinary lesson addressing science, computer science, engineering, and mathematics standards. By integrating science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, students can see the real-world connections between these subjects, encouraging a deeper understanding and preparing them for the complex challenges of the future. These lessons enhance their academic growth and inspire creativity and collaboration, essential skills for success in the rapidly evolving world.},

This type of thinking promotes learning through the application of planning, analysis, abstraction and decomposition of problems into their constituent parts.

In education, the mechanisms used to foster CP are diverse; among them, learning through programming. Databases of source code generated in learning exercises using the CP method are a valuable tool for discovering learning patterns. However, there are no robust and scalable methods for studying the huge source code bases of learning products to recognize the predominant patterns and determine the effectiveness of the method. Consequently, a comprehensive analysis of learners’ skills, knowledge, outcomes and performance levels is necessary to identify points of improvement to meet learning objectives and modify curricula and exercises.

The augmented reality (AR) digital game is specifically directed towards fundamental CT skills, such as pattern recognition, decomposition, abstraction, and developing algorithms. To evaluate the effectiveness of the AR game in enhancing CT skills, a study was conducted with 124 middle school students, entailing in grades 6th and 8th. The experimental group (N = 63) utilized the AR game, while the control group (N = 61) relied on conventional text materials. The findings of the experiment strongly supported the integration of AR technology along with game-based learning as a means to enhance CT knowledge and skills while simultaneously reducing cognitive load.},

However, there is currently no validated tool for assessing Computational Thinking (CT) that performs reliably across disciplines and age groups. In the absence of such a tool, this paper examines several software testing methods for the evaluation of CT pedagogy effectiveness within serious games. Namely, it makes recommendations for the application of standardized questionnaires, think-aloud testing, and automated data logging for evaluating games that promote CT learning. It concludes with a potential use case to demonstrate how the methods can be combined to achieve a granular and actionable understanding of a complex CT assessment problem and its causes.},

Many primary and secondary schools adopt graphical programming as an important way for students' computational thinking development. However, elementary school students have less self-control in learning and are more dependent on teachers, so timely and effective teaching interaction is an important guarantee for the realization of the teaching goals of graphical programming. Through three rounds of action research, the essay investigated the impact of teaching interaction strategies on the development of students' computational thinking. The findings show that students are satisfied with the designed interaction strategies, and the interaction strategies can significantly improve students' computational thinking ability and level.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to design a computational thinking curriculum standard for K-12 education. The Delphi technique was employed to collect different views and derive consensus from a panel of thirteen experts, including computer scientists, computer science educators, K-12 computer teachers, and industry experts. The first draft of Delphi survey questionnaire, consisting of nine themes (problem solving, problem decomposition, algorithms, data representation, data analysis, modeling and simulation, abstraction, automation, and others) and 60 competence indicators, was developed based on our investigation of the nature of computational thinking. After three rounds of survey and a final round-table discussion, the expert panel derived 49 essential competence indicators (13 for grades K to 6, nine for grades 7 to 9 and 27 of grades 10 to 12) and eight optional competence indicators (one for grades 7 to 9 and seven for grades 10 to 12). According to the results, the core ability and training of computational thinking are different in grades. In grades K to 6, students develop logical thinking and problem solving skills in personal and family life. In grades 7 to 9, students must understand the basic concepts of programming and write basic programs. Finally, in grades 10 to 12, they will use high-level skills to apply the concepts of abstraction, modeling, and structured problem decomposition to solve problems in different fields. The results serve as useful references for developing Taiwan's new K-12 computing curriculum.},

It was found that thinking style, learning attitude and academic performance all had a significant positive effect on K-12 students' computational thinking, and programming experience could have a significant effect on K-12 students' computational thinking through the chain mediation of thinking style, learning attitude and academic performance. In addition, the moderation analysis revealed that there is a moderating role of grade in the above relationships.

The findings indicated that the students of the Department of Computer Engineering possessed prior experiences in programming or computational thinking. Their learning sequences limitedly impacted learning outcomes. Conversely, for the students of the Department of Information Management, learning computational thinking before programming did not result in better learning outcomes, emphasizing the need for coherence in courses. The students of the Department of Mechanical Engineering showed the practical value of computational thinking in non-IT disciplines, particularly in using specialized software such as MATLAB. For students with foundational knowledge, the learning sequence between learning computational thinking and programming was less significant. However, for beginners or those from non-IT backgrounds, effective learning required the coherence and integration of courses. Thus, it is required to maintain cross-course coherence and establish links between computational thinking and programming skills to offer a more in-depth learning experience.},

  abstract = {This article illustrates that the task design and problem selection are of characteristic influence to evoke sense-reason-act programming (SRA) among primary school pupils when programming robots. Research shows that the task design influences the development of computational thinking (CT). The literature provides evidence that the context, the problem space, and the representation of the problem to apply SRA-programming require the programming task to be embedded in a dynamic context in which a programmable robot must use sensory information to anticipate changes in the environment. In order to ascertain whether the problem space and the task design influence the evocation of SRA-thinking, this article uses a research design comparing the differences between two programming conditions (static/dynamic). In these conditions, pupils use Lego EV-3 robots and Mindstorms software to solve programming problems. As a post-measurement, a Lego challenge is applied. In this article, it is shown that the integration of a dynamic task design to solve a programming problem is essential for a deeper understanding of CT skills. Furthermore, when pupils can immediately test the consequences of their program in a dynamic environment and, thus, the learning environment provides an appropriate problem, they gain a deeper understanding of the added value of sensors and will be better able to reason about complex problems. It is found that programming in a dynamic problem environment almost naturally evokes SRA-thinking, as opposed to programming in a static environment. The influence of SRA-programming as demonstrated identifies characteristics of CT.},

However it is important to go deeper and understand how computational thinking activities fosters the cognitive development of the young, especially if we want them to have “a significant advantage in problem solving”, becoming innovative thinkers [1]. To be innovative it is necessary that a person use sophisticated cognitive structures to reason over abstractions and deal with hypothesis. These are the characteristics of the formal operational thinking [2]. Therefore, this paper is about the use of formal thinking on computational thinking activities over a digital fabrication project developed in a Brazilian makerspace (POALab FabLab). Using a Case Study we want to show that computational thinking and digital fabrication projects demand the use of formal thinking and, since that, the importance of designing learning activities for makerspaces taking in mind the possibilities of cognitive development.},

Computational thinking promises understanding of information technology and its utilization without necessarily knowing how to write code. According to many authors, skills in computational thinking include the ability to evaluate and design solutions to problems. However, the vision for computational thinking, laid out by a number of scholars, is even bigger than this. It proposes that thinking habits from computer science are beneficial for any kind of problem solving and that those thinking habits form a central part of modern sciences. It might be that components of computational thinking are indeed useful in problem solving and that they play an important part in other sciences. However, computer science combines three types of thinking traditions: theoretical (mathematical) tradition, engineering tradition and scientific tradition, and it is important to differentiate between what is an aspect in one or more of these traditions and what is unique for computer science. This clarification will support the application and teaching of computational thinking. This paper explores the uniqueness of computational thinking and its roots in theoretical, engineering and scientific traditions of computing.},

Based on our belief in the importance of the application of computational thinking skills when using computerized environments, and the importance of its significant application in developing an understanding of any discipline, the course is based on the development of simulations of computational processes in any area of knowledge. We widely discuss the pedagogical challenges of developing a MOOC on thinking skills without teacher-learner interaction, and share how we overcame these challenges by implementing the Four Pedagogies for Developing Computational Thinking (4P4CT) framework, which integrates the pedagogies of active learning, project-based learning, product-based learning, and context-based learning.

We found the most liked designs of the online makerspace and examined which of them included programming features (iterations, conditional statements and functions/modules) and could foster computational thinking elements such as abstract and algorithmic thinking, pattern recognition, and decomposition.

  abstract = {The rise of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 and the increasing reliance on the digital economy drive the need for a new set of skills, especially in robotics learning, that includes computational thinking (CT) and adversarial thinking (AT) for the young generation. The need for CT-related skills includes various fields, such as robotics, engineering, computer science, mathematics, music, arts, and humanities. Therefore, adopting robotic learning with CT and AT can enhance learning skills over the conventional learning model. This paper presents a systematic literature review on CT and AT practices in robotics learning to improve educational methods. This study conducts a systematic literature review from four databases: ACM, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and ScienceDirect. Sixty-five studies in robotics learning to increase CT and AT skills were analyzed by applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study’s findings show that CT and AT are significant in training students to engage in robotics learning activities. These considerations will lead to strengthening their skill and critical thinking. The study also suggests that integrating these skills can prepare teachers for critical thinking and boost student learning. The findings suggest that CT and AT can directly adopt digital adversarial learning skills to improve overall robotics learning activities. For future studies, the difference in learning ages related to robotics activities with CT and AT applications can be studied to deeply comprehend the effectiveness of CT and AT applications.},

The results showed that CT was a significant direct predictor of academic achievement; problem-solving ability and learning anxiety played significant mediator roles between CT and students’ academic achievement. CT can improve students’ problem-solving ability and reduce anxiety, which leads to better academic performance.},

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) concept is a problem-solving approach that includes logical ordering, analyzing data and preparing solutions with the help of different visualization tools like flowcharts, graphs, pie charts etc. CT is not just used by computer programmer, but it can also be used by students and teachers in any classroom so that teaching learning process becomes successful. CT is an important element for the expansion of computer software, along with providing the huge support to problem solving skills across all disciplines of education like engineering, science, humanities and K12 education. It gives a logical idea to the students to solve a problem systematically using algorithm development, flowchart design and programming and problem-solving skills. CT increases the confidence among students in dealing with complexity of difficult problems, the capacity to handle complex issues and collaborate with others to find a shared purpose or solution. In this research paper, authors discuss the impact of CT among the students of different specialization of engineering and K12 by using different problem-solving techniques and strategies such as modeling, making sub goals, pruning and searching so that students will be able to think differently towards new problems.},

However, how to effectively integrate CT-STEM into every link of undergraduate curriculum teaching by means of task-driven approaches, project-based cases and other methods still remains to be further explored and tapped. Based on this, taking the chapter "Database Connection and Application" as an example, this paper explores how to use a project-based case, the task-driven method, and group collaboration to comprehensively integrate CT-STEM into the teaching process of specialized courses through four key phases: pre-class design, in-class development, post-class assignments, and project evaluation. The purpose is to strengthen students' higher-order thinking and teamwork awareness, thereby improving their comprehensive abilities to analyze and solve complex problems. The entire idea of the project-based teaching design elaborated in this paper can serve as a valuable reference for university teachers and educators.},

However, there remains a significant gap in the availability of intelligent tools that effectively foster computational thinking in line with contemporary educational needs. To address this, the present study proposes a gamified intelligent tutoring system that supports learners' CT development through a process-oriented assessment methodology and targeted guidance. The assessment framework leverages machine learning algorithms to construct predictive models based on the frequency of six behavioral elements observed during gameplay, including a process-oriented failure risk assessment model for formative evaluation and a summative computational thinking level assessment model. The system identifies the critical process element contributing most to the prediction outcome to provide targeted guidance for learners at risk of failure or exhibiting low computational performance. Using a dataset of 754 real learner cases, five machine learning algorithms were compared, and multi-metric evaluation confirmed strong predictive performance, with accuracy exceeding 80%. Logistic regression was selected as the final algorithm due to its simplicity, efficiency, and interpretability, ensuring practical applicability. The tool will enable the scaling and personalization of computational thinking development.},

Comparing with existing models, three changes are made: (1) a pathway called inner loop is added from motor controller to thalamus; (2) a memory controller is added in front of long-term declarative memory, which can judge whether the memory operation is retrieval or not; (3) two new modules, Active Object buffer (AO) and Active Action buffer, are separated out of the general working memory model. With CAUT architecture, a dynamic cognitive model is put out with which typical thinking processes can be interpreted and described more precisely. Problem solving are demonstrated with this model, and two typical problems, decision problem and search problem, are interpreted. Experiments with ACT-R indicate that CAUT is consistent with ACT-R in functional level, and the description can be easily transformed into ACT-R model, and CAUT architecture can be taken as a meta-description and design tool to construct cognitive model. Experiments with ACT-R also indicate the effectiveness of CAUT architecture.},

However, there is a scarcity of information available regarding the challenges faced by students and the development of their conceptual knowledge in these learning environments, particularly in relation to the integrated curriculum. There is a need to help with course-level curriculum development to improve teaching and learning. Hence, this paper proposes an artificial intelligence-based student computational thinking analysis model (AI-SCTAM) to predict student engagement in learning and improve curriculum development. This research attempted to determine the association between student engagement measures using the machine learning (ML) method to determine the degrees of student involvement. The ML divides students into two groups: highly engaged and poorly engaged, according to the criteria used to measure their degree of involvement. The findings of the correlation study showed a positive association between engagement measures and performance. Analyzing the relationship between student engagement and performance will guide the development of course materials and activities. STEM education metrics based on engagement levels will be proposed to personalize students' learning experiences.},

However, conventional assessment methods like questionnaires can produce disengaged responses or require additional work to understand the questions and have limitations in the assessment of dynamic self-efficacy. To address this challenge, this study proposes a method using in-game features to assess self-efficacy, which can change over the playtime. The employed in-game feature is the Planning Stage, in which learners strategize and prepare their approach before engaging with challenges. We collect data on the time spent in this stage, which is newly proposed in this study. The experiment was conducted with twenty-five students in the Multimedia Technology and Animation Major playing Tenacity-P to accomplish tasks from a computer programming course. To validate the method, we compared self-efficacy results from the game-based approach with those from conventional questionnaires. The findings highlight the need for strategic planning in managing difficult tasks. As challenges increased, performance measures varied more, underscoring the importance of strong problem-solving skills. Efficient strategic planning directly improved self-efficacy, as participants with better planning skills maintained higher self-efficacy despite increasing task difficulty.},

In spite of significant studies, investment and efforts, math skills and widespread enthusiasm for SET remain elusive. In South Africa's disadvantaged communities, poor quality maths teaching and poor maths performance, both legacies of past political engineering, further fuel marginalization. Computational thinking is a new characterization of some specific procedural thinking, abstraction, problem solving and organizational skills that are finding their way from computer science programs into other fields. The paper describes our refocus of content in BingBee, a SET skill-building kiosk project targeting disadvantaged communities. As we shift to emphasize computational thinking more explicitly, we speculate that these skills could complement, and perhaps eventually displace, some elements of maths as the dominant driver of SET. The confluence of better tools, open service interfaces, and the rapid spread of handsets and devices into marginalized communities is an opportunity to build more widespread computational thinking skills. This could in turn facilitate a future Internet which is more inclusive, and in which users are able to create their own services.},

  abstract = {With the development of the era of artificial intelligence(AI), China has put forward the cultivation of computational thinking(CT) in the compulsory education curriculum standard. CT includes three dimensions: CT concept, CT practice, and CT perspective. As a part of CT, the development of the CT perspective can promote the growth of students ‘ connection ability, questioning ability, and expression ability. CT perspective promotes the formation of computational identity through the internalization of concepts. At present, there are relatively few studies on the CT perspective. Based on this, this study proposes a design-based STEM + AI teaching model, aiming to create a combination of artificial intelligence and interdisciplinary to cultivate pupils ‘ CT perspective and form their computational identity. In this study, a single group of pre-test and post-test experiments were conducted to test the CT perspective and computational identity of students in the third grade of a primary school in Wuhan. The research shows that the design-based STEM + AI teaching has significantly improved the expression ability and questioning ability of primary school students in the CT perspective, as well as the correlation ability, participation ability, realization ability, and goal-setting ability in the computational identity. The implementation of STEM + AI teaching helps students to internalize ideas from the perspective of CT, thus cultivating students' computational identity.},

In addition to teaching the fundamentals of computational thinking, music programming, and logic, the course addresses the Four C’s of education. The change in students’ attitudes toward computer and algorithmic skills, creativity, communication, and collaboration is measured using a pre- and post-test experimental design. Additionally, computational thinking abilities are assessed through the administration of music analysis, procedural, graphical, and logic quizzes, while creativity is evaluated through a qualitative grading of the students’ final music projects. Results show a general perceived improvement of the students’ attitudes toward the Four C’s as well as a good ability to convert learned computational models into musical creativity. However, more effort is needed in order to guarantee an overall improvement in the students’ actual computational thinking abilities.},

  abstract = {In recent years, engineering education has become one of the challenging issues in Thailand education. By teaching and learning subjects independently, students are limited to subject-oriented problems, which are not in reality. To address these flaws, integrating knowledge across disciplines becomes significantly necessary. In the past years, STEM has been accepted as one of the effective strategies to bridge the difference in nature of each field to construct more practical projects and innovations. Moreover, the educational robot can be employed as a learning tool in that strategy since it not only provides challenging learning missions but also promotes computational thinking for the students. Therefore, this research study proposed STEM learning activities on three-day workshop to lay out the foundation to the high-school science-and-technology students who are becoming the engineering students. The workshop comprises of eight phases to facilitate their learning inquiry process with hands-on experience; moreover, the activities were designed in consideration of promoting computational thinking with challenging learning missions. The findings of this study showed that the proposed workshop activities are beneficial for the students who outperformed on robotics with higher computational thinking; meanwhile, they could provide more relevant responses regarding the proposed learning activities.},

Background: In the field of computer science, computational thinking is defined as a method that enhances problem-solving skills, system design, and human behavior understanding. Over the last few decades, several tools have been proposed for the development of computational thinking skills; however, there is no area of study that evaluates the implications or the impact that these types of platforms have on users belonging to any knowledge area. Research Question: Do user interfaces influence the development of computational thinking skills? Methodology: To address this issue, a systematic review of the literature was conducted using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) methodology for analyzing and evaluating scientific publications. Findings: The results show that despite the dearth of literature on the subject, the specific design of a user interface has a significant impact on the development of computational thinking. Bearing the above in mind, it is necessary to conduct research that delves more deeply into the effects caused by the technologies that are used to develop computational thinking, this being a line of research that is worthy of consideration.},

  abstract = {Game-based learning (GBL) can motivate learners and enable them to engage in their learning experience. Additionally, the popularity of GBL has grown in computer science and programming courses, where it can be used to develop computational thinking (CT) skills. CT is critical thinking used to apply fundamental concepts and reasoning derived from computing and computer science. Research has shown that digital GBL can improve critical thinking skills and help learners understand programming concepts, structures, and problem-solving strategies. Despite the popularity of digital GBL, analog card games and bingo games are still valuable and effective tools for learning. However, most studies on GBL that aim to train critical thinking skills have focused on digital approaches. This indicates a gap in the body of knowledge because few studies have explored the effectiveness of analog games for developing CT skills through GBL. The theoretical framework of this study is grounded in two learning theories. Constructivist theory frames learning as the construction of knowledge through a process of action, reflection, and construction. Constructionist learning theory calls for construction of artifacts, learner agency, authentic purpose, or authentic audience during the process. To investigate the design of GBL for developing CT skills and to generate discourse for its widespread adoption, the current study implemented design-based research (DBR) in an undergraduate computer science course for non-computer science majors. By addressing the gap in the literature on GBL for CT skill development, the study aimed to investigate complex learner experiences, including learner struggles and successes, alignment with learning theory principles, and design moves for future iterations of the project. The research question posed is: how can we optimize CT learning through GBL, based on learner experiences and learning theories? Prior to this study, the instructor used GBL in which learners played an analog, three-dimensional tic-tac-toe game with ping pong balls and then wrote a computer program that simulated that game. We chose to conduct DBR to strengthen the learning associated with this activity. DBR uses iterative designs to develop knowledge that improves educational practices. In the spring of 2023, we assessed the extent to which the non-digital game and programming the simulated game enhanced learners' CT skills by analyzing their experiences with CT. This involved collecting and analyzing learner surveys to gain insight into their learning experiences. Using network analysis and betweenness centrality measures, the data will be analyzed to identify learner struggles and successes. The results are expected to be available by August 2023. The contributions of this study include identifying effective design principles for GBL, optimizing CT learning, and generating discourse for the widespread adoption of GBL in computer science education.},

Combining the top two open-source data science tools, Python (within Jupyter notebooks) and R (within R studio software), we illustrate some of results from data preprocessing (cleaning, wrangling) for the diagnostic primary-school test of inquiry skills where Python tools (e.g. Pandas library) became more advantageous. As for the subsequent intensive statistical analysis, R environment was more suitable. We demonstrate summary results of the statistical analysis of the computer thinking diagnostic test for primary and secondary schools, finally cross-checked in SPSS software. Due to the current COVID-19 situation, we are still collecting data from ITA project impacts for which we finally show how we plan to implement further methods for data collecting, analysis and implementation in collaboration with our colleagues - education researchers.},

  abstract = {This research article assesses the concepts of Computational Thinking (CT) as applied in basic education. Although widely used in K12 education, many articles indicate a lack of uniformity in the conceptualization of CT. CT is defined as the systematic problem-solving ability based on algorithmic processes. It is seen as crucial for stimulating interest and diversity in STEM careers. Effective CT teaching requires precise conceptualization and appropriate teaching techniques. With the world's increasing digitization, CT is considered as fundamental as reading or math skills and should be taught from K12 education. This article reports a systematic mapping of CT con-cepts applied in K12 activities, reflecting on the chosen activities and teaching techniques. Despite some articles highlighting the unclear definition of CT, there is a notable agreement on its key concepts. The study used the IEEEXplore database, analyzing primary articles from 2019–2023. The findings reveal a high degree of similarity in CT concepts, indicating a trend towards standardization. A catalog of frequently cited activities used to teach CT is presented, aiding teachers in introducing CT in their classes. This study supports the development of teaching policies and initiatives. contributing to STEM interest and diversity.},

  abstract = {This Innovative Practice Full Paper details a design-based research approach for implementing computational learning activities in a first-year engineering physics course. This study contributes to the growing body of research on computation in engineering education by introducing computational concepts and activities during a physics laboratory class. Drawing from Experiential Learning Theory and using an adapted version of the Use-Modify-Create framework for teaching computational thinking, a series of lab activities was designed that combined physical lab experiments with computational modeling using custom-built VPython simulations. Data was collected from the labs in the form of (1) responses to lab activity worksheets, (2) code modified and/or generated by the students during lab activities, (3) in-code comments provided by the students during the activities. A qualitative thematic analysis was used to analyze students' learning benefits and any challenges faced during the activities. While results show a number of learning benefits, an observed homogeneity of student responses to the questions on the lab handouts point to a set of potential limitations within the activities themselves that warranted further examination. Insight gained from this analysis process is presented as a set of four design principles that will inform future implementations of the hybrid course design.},

The experimental group (N=49) used the virtual simulation platform, while the control group (N=49) created projects using traditional WPS documents. The results indicate that virtual simulation technology positively influences students' creativity and computational thinking. However, no statistically significant differences were observed in the sub-dimensions of critical thinking, algorithmic thinking, and curiosity. The findings suggest that integrating three-dimensional immersive virtual simulation can effectively enhance creativity and computational thinking in interdisciplinary teaching.

Although there is an increasing interest in research in teaching and learning computational thinking in recent years, an engaging, effective online learning system is yet to be built for teaching, learning, and applying computational thinking online. To this end, we have developed DATAVIEW, an online social learning system for learning computational thinking concepts and skills online. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) we developed a new, effective online learning model for computational thinking based on our previous widely-applied R2D2 model. A signature characteristic of this new model is being interactive and learner-centered, thus "i" is carried out through the entire learning experiences, which provides teaching facilities to instructors and interactional tools among instructors and learners, 2) we implemented, validated, and refined iR2D2 in our DATAVIEW computational thinking online service, 3) We propose to use the DBR (design-based-research) approach to study the relationship between technology and teaching in the context of computational thinking, generating research results and findings applicable to online teaching in other domains as well.},

However, Chinese education in Indonesia is fundamentally based on studies of Mainland China, therefore lacking opportunities for students to understand profoundly Taiwan's language and culture. Furthermore, there is a lack of opportunities for students to understand game design power and industry in Taiwan. The purpose of this on-going program (2014-recent) is to enhance the understanding of game and animation design education in Taiwan, through exchanges with students in Indonesia. It aims to promote exchanges between the faculty and students at the universities with faculties, lecturers and artists in Taiwan for collaborative work, especially in game art design, game engine and animation. It sincerely hopes that students could understand profoundly Taiwan's language and culture by game and animation online tutorials, and provide opportunities for students to understand game design power and industry in Taiwan, Indonesia, and worldwide market. After a year of implementing the four points mentioned in this article, we have already observed some evident outcome. The biggest achievement comes from the workshop which has received significant responses and an increasing number of attendances from both Taiwan and Indonesia. In the near future, it hopes that we can hold a public event such as lecture, workshop and exhibition to raise awareness of and develop an affinity with Taiwanese langue and culture among the general public using the design thinking approach for computational creativity, such as co-design Taiwan language on-line course or game-based learning.},

  abstract = {The era of big data witnesses that ‘computing’ has become an indispensable tool for medical development in many aspects of medicine domain. The ability of computational thinking is of great significance to medical students engaging in basic research and clinical diagnosis and treatment in the future. However, medical students are lack of this strategy in dealing with problems at present. Meanwhile, there is also a problem of ‘insufficient skills and no training’ in computer learning. In this article, we recommend training students’ computational thinking from three aspects. First, students can learn the basic concepts of computational thinking and different thinking modes of computer scientists through computer courses in both theory and practice in order to train their computational thinking. Second, in the process of thinking, students can directly carry out divergent thinking, logical integration, and practice the thinking methods of scientists such as abstraction and simplification through the mind maps produced by IMindMap software. Third, during the practice of modeling and programming, after using mind maps to make the problem abstract and sort out the content of the creation to draw a flowchart, students start modeling and systematic design through Scratch software. At last, under the help of MATLAB, some specific medical cases enable students to apply computational thinking to practice comprehensively. Our practice in class shows that these training methods has positive influence in improving students computational thinking.},

  abstract = {Computational thinking has become a interesting subject and important concept in education throughout the nation. Computational Thinking (CT) has been defined as an important skill as digital literacy that must be learned by next generation. Along with the need to make an agreed definition of CT many countries are still in the process of, or have not started, introducing CT into the curriculum at all levels of education. It was also found in Indonesia that Computer Science / Computing, which could be the most obvious place to teach CT, has not been the main subject in several schools. This research aim is to design an alternative CT learning media to study interestingly and effectively computational concept which consists of 4 elements, namely decomposition, abstraction, pattern recognition and algorithm. Research and Development followed by ADDIE development model (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Evaluation) is used to capture the problem, identify the user need to be implemented in digital media. This learning media application product is equipped with an educational game based on computational thinking. The media has several features such as presentation of material and examples of problems and the solution, and small challenges in a games consisting of 3 stages. The subjects of this study were students of K-12. The data used for analysis was collected in several ways, including observation, questionnaire, pre-test and post-test in similar question. The result is the use of CT learning media is very helpful to improve students' understanding of CT in problem solving even in different topics.},

  abstract = {This work-in-progress paper will explore the effectiveness of topic modeling to support the analysis of Colombian teachers' conceptions of computational thinking (in Spanish) in an online professional development program. Computational thinking has become a form of literacy as it can help individuals to solve problems. Consequently, governments and bodies of accreditation worldwide have supported educational initiatives, primarily at the K-12 level. However, curricular changes are not enough. Teachers need to be prepared, so they develop the content knowledge associated with computational thinking concepts, practices, and applications in the classroom. To contribute to professional development opportunities geared toward the development of computational thinking pedagogical content knowledge, the Colombian National Academy of Exact, Physics, and Natural Sciences and the Global Center for Equitable Computer Science Education implemented an open online professional development program for Latin American early childhood and elementary educators. More than 100 teachers enrolled in a six-week online professional development program to integrate computational thinking activities from early childhood education. The program included two modules focused on conceptual understanding of computational thinking in early childhood and four more modules where the participants adapted, designed, implemented learning activities, and reflected on what happened during the implementation. As part of the participants' weekly interactions, the program included a Jamboard space, where the teachers answered a set of guiding questions, just like a discussion forum, but as a post-it wall, where they could access all their peers' contributions and questions in a single space.},

  abstract = {Graphs, which encode pairwise relations between entities, serve as a fundamental data structure across real-world domains. Many critical applications can be formulated as graph-based tasks, and graph machine learning (GML), from the shallow embedding models to graph neural networks and further advanced to the most powerful graph transformers, has been well-established to automate knowledge discovery and decision-making on graphs. In parallel, the recent emergence of large foundational models has driven machine learning into a new era of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI), and this revolution presents both unprecedented opportunities and profound challenges for the well-established GML paradigms. However, few investigations have analyzed and envisioned how GML should evolve to harness these opportunities, address these challenges, and embrace this new Gen-AI era. To fill in this gap, we organize the first international Workshop on Machine Learning on Graphs in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence (MLoG-GenAI), held in connection with the 31st ACM Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, which provides a venue to gather academic researchers and industry practitioners to discuss and picture the development of GML in the new Gen-AI era.},

In this paper, we contribute the design and implementation of a smartphone-based chatbot that detects artwork, generates textual and auditory information, and interactively answers visitors’ questions. To explore visitors’ experience with it, we conducted a field experiment (N=30) at the National Art Museum, comparing it to the existing museum application. Our results indicate that visitors showed higher artwork engagement with the chatbot than the museum application. Moreover, they enjoyed an interactive experience using the chatbot to learn about the art collection and have equally preferred textual and auditory information representation.},

We examined students’ GAI usage using conversational data and screen recordings from 12 groups, each comprising three university students. A coding framework was developed through hybrid thematic analysis to capture students’ GAI use behaviors at both individual and group levels. Four types of behaviors were identified: prompting, information sharing, information use, and evaluation. Based on this framework, we conducted a correlation analysis to examine how these behaviors were related to students’ knowledge construction. The results showed that GAI use behaviors involving sharing or comparing responses were correlated with lower levels of knowledge construction, whereas behaviors involving co-editing and evaluating were correlated with higher levels. This study contributes a new framework for analyzing individual and collective use of GAI in collaborative learning and offers pedagogical insights that guide students’ effective use of GAI tools in teaching practice.},

  abstract = {It has recently emerged that generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been significantly developed and can create realistic speech, images, and video. Although such innovations provide many advantages, they pose major threats to the network's security. The research question of the study will, therefore, be the role and effects of generative artificial intelligence on network security, especially deepfake, artificial intelligence-driven phishing, and multimedia content manipulation. This research uses a case study analysis of real-life experiences of security threats in networked systems to show how generative AI can be misused. The findings reveal that: 1. Generative AI can create highly developed cyberattacks such as deepfake social engineering and AI-supplemented phishing, which use visually and audibly persuasive appeals to manipulate users. 2. The problem with this kind of security threat highlighted by AI is that most traditional security solutions lack awareness of such threats since they are incapable of effective real-time user authentication, over-dependence on visual and biometric verification, and lack of AI-awareness training. 3. There are significant gaps in cybersecurity policies and training. Many organizations lack formal protocols for addressing AI-related security risks, and often, organizations are applying generative AI technologies. In addressing the aforementioned vulnerabilities, the study recommends an improved security model that incorporates deepfake detection, more secure authentication, and even advanced anomaly detection systems. In furtherance, there should be improvements in policy that aim at commanding the AI media, ensuring comprehensive training of the employees on cybersecurity matters, and drives that aim at educating the public on how to enhance the strength for discouraging AI cybercrimes.},

  abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems bring innovative ways of information provision and knowledge delivery. In the public sector, generative AI has the potential to decrease bureaucratic discretion in the decision-making process. Increasing reliance on this technology brings challenges of unfair treatment, colonized responses from the system, and data governance. Because of historical interaction, tribal communities are the most underrepresented in policy planning and implementation. Indigenous communities suffer from the neglect of tribal sovereignty by the U.S. federal government and limited accessibility and literacy in the digital world. Generative AI systems exacerbate these challenges with insufficient tribal input. However, the negative impact can be alleviated with digital equity and knowledge cocreation. Digital equity emphasizes the importance of tribal knowledge representation, and knowledge cocreation focuses on the collaboration between Indigenous communities and relevant actors in data governance for generative AI systems. This study proposes two research questions to discuss tribal knowledge cocreation in generative AI systems: (1) what are the biases in the system responses from the tribal perspective? (2) what are the potential resolutions for these problems? The findings from in-depth interviews with tribal members in the U.S. indicate that the insufficient articulation of tribal culture, the lack of crucial tribal historical events, and the inappropriate appellation of tribal nations are the primary drawbacks in the system responses. From the Indigenous perspective, tribal oral traditions, native publications and documents, and collaboration with tribal governments can address the problems of generative AI responses. This study contributes to the theory development of digital equity and knowledge cocreation in tribal generative AI system responses. Policy recommendations and future research agendas are included in this research.},

  abstract = {The utilization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools like ChatGPT and DeepSeek is bringing about significant changes in educational practices and learning environments. This alteration underlines the necessity to look into how AI can enhance ethics education for the youth. This research reveals that the capabilities of GAI match up well with the requirements of youth ethics education in four principal ways: (1) crafting immersive, multi-sensory scenarios to boost student interest. By creating such scenarios, students can get more engaged and excited about learning. (2) Employing adaptive methods for precise interventions. This means being able to adjust the teaching approach according to each student's specific situation to make the intervention more effective. (3) Generating personalized content to customize the delivery of knowledge. Every student is different, and personalized content can better meet their individual learning needs. (4) Offering real-time analysis to improve teaching methods. With real-time analysis, teachers can quickly understand how students are doing and make timely adjustments. Based on these connections, this study puts forward a framework that incorporates GAI into crucial parts of the teaching process: integrating comprehensive learning data. This helps to have a more complete understanding of students' learning progress. Developing evidence-based strategies. So that teaching decisions are made with solid evidence. Creating differentiated content. To cater to the diverse needs of students. And assessing outcomes in multiple dimensions. This integration not only enhances the efficiency of moral education but also provides a scalable model for applying AI-driven teaching innovations across different subjects.},

With recent developments in Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI), current research tries to tackle these constraints by deploying AI-generated content (AIGC) in AR applications. However, our preliminary study with six AR practitioners revealed that the current AIGC lacks contextual information to adapt to varying application scenarios and is therefore limited in authoring. To utilize the strong generative power of GenAI to ease the authoring of AR instruction while capturing the context, we developed CARING-AI, an AR system to author context-aware humanoid-avatar-based instructions with GenAI. By navigating in the environment, users naturally provide contextual information to generate humanoid-avatar animation as AR instructions that blend in the context spatially and temporally. We showcased three application scenarios of CARING-AI: Asynchronous Instructions, Remote Instructions, and Ad Hoc Instructions based on a design space of AIGC in AR Instructions. With two user studies (N=12), we assessed the system usability of CARING-AI and demonstrated the easiness and effectiveness of authoring with Gen-AI.},

The BOPPPS (Bridge-in, Objective, Pre-assessment, Participatory learning, Post-assessment, Summary) teaching model provides a structured format for lesson planning and instruction, with the purpose of enhancing student learning and engagement. However, there are still some challenges in the use of the BOPPPS model in practice teaching. For instance, it will take a lot time and energy for teachers to prepare personalized learning resources in different forms and of high quality, and the assessment of students' learning outcomes is difficult to be performed in real time. The following paper discusses how to apply GenAI to the six steps of the BOPPPS teaching model, and in turn, assist the teacher with each of these areas.},

While recent advances in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI (generative artificial intelligence)) enable automated generation of landscape renderings, the End to End (endtoend) methods are not compatible with common design processes, leading to insufficient alignment with design idealizations and limited cohesion of iterative landscape design. Informed by a formative study for comprehending design requirements, we present PlantoGraphy, an iterative design system that allows for interactive configuration of generative artificial intelligence models to accommodate human-centered design practice. A two-stage pipeline is incorporated: first, the concretization module transforms conceptual ideas into concrete scene layouts with a domain-oriented large language model; and second, the illustration module converts scene layouts into realistic landscape renderings with a layout-guided diffusion model Fine-tune (finetune)ed through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) (lora). PlantoGraphy has undergone a series of performance evaluations and user studies, demonstrating its effectiveness in landscape rendering generation and the high recognition of its interactive functionality.},

It is found that AIGC can greatly improve the production efficiency and support the real-time optimisation of dynamic marketing strategies through data-driven multimodal content generation; however, the application of the technology faces the risks of content homogenisation, algorithmic black-boxing and user privacy leakage. This paper proposes a synergistic mechanism of ‘technology embedding - institutional constraints - user feedback’ to achieve sustainable development, which provides a theoretical basis and a practical path for the design of the governance framework of AIGC in the platform economy.},

However, multimodal feedback-integrating textual, auditory, and visual cues-promises a more engaging and effective learning experience. By leveraging multiple sensory channels, multimodal feedback better accommodates diverse learning preferences and aids in deeper information retention. Despite its potential, creating multimodal feedback poses challenges, including the need for increased time and resources. Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offer solutions to automate the feedback process, predominantly focusing on textual feedback. Yet, the application of GenAI in generating multimodal feedback remains largely unexplored. Our study investigates the use of GenAI techniques to generate multimodal feedback, aiming to provide this feedback for large cohorts of learners, thereby enhancing learning experience and engagement. By exploring the potential of GenAI for this purpose, we propose a framework for automating the generation of multimodal feedback, which we name MuFIN.},

Students may view generative AI as a means to an end of achieving a perfect grade, skipping important elements of the learning process, or they may view it as an opportunity to expand their creative efforts. Faculty may view it as a tool students use to circumvent plagiarism detection, may feel it potentially minimizes the role of faculty in the classroom, or they may view it as an opportunity to avail of a supplement to existing activities and assignments. Ultimately, faculty are faced with maintaining academic integrity and reinforcing the need and importance of the learning process.

  abstract = {Generative AI models have revolutionized intelligent systems by enabling machines to produce human-like content across diverse domains. However, their outputs often exhibit unpredictability due to complex and opaque internal semantic states, posing challenges for reliability in real-world applications. In this article, we introduce the AI Uncertainty Principle, a novel theoretical framework inspired by quantum mechanics, to model and quantify the inherent unpredictability in generative AI outputs. By drawing parallels with the uncertainty principle and superposition, we formalize the tradeoff between the precision of internal semantic states and output variability. Through comprehensive experiments involving state-of-the-art models and a variety of prompt designs, we analyze how factors such as specificity, complexity, tone, and style influence model behavior. Our results demonstrate that carefully engineered prompts can significantly enhance output predictability and consistency, while excessive complexity or irrelevant information can increase uncertainty. We also show that ensemble techniques, such as Sigma-weighted aggregation across models and prompt variations, effectively improve reliability. Our findings have profound implications for the development of intelligent systems, emphasizing the critical role of prompt engineering and theoretical modeling in creating AI technologies that perceive, reason, and act predictably in the real world.},

However, due to a lack of adequate resources and the desire to engage students in the creation process, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is utilized to generate mathematical stories accompanied by images. This study presents a framework for automatic quality assessment to evaluate the coherence of multimodal text and images generated by GAI, as well as the appropriateness of the stories for different grade levels. The dataset comprises mathematical stories generated by GAI for grades 3, 4, and 5, obtained from an American online learning platform, each story consisting of titles, bodies, and image illustrations generated by GP4, images generated by DALL-E3. Initially, a method is devised based on CLIP model and Mini-GPT4 for extracting multimodal semantic features to establish the relationship between text and images in mathematical stories and their generation parameters. Subsequently, mathematical text features are designed, including nine mathematical text attributes and ten traditional text readability indicators, followed by collinearity feature selection and statistical testing. Finally, five machine learning grade regressor for mathematical stories were trained, and the correlation between these 19 features and grades is explored using genetic algorithm-based factor mining and the interpretable artificial intelligence method SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). To further understand advanced text features, the latest natural language processing (NLP) readability indicators are also integrated into the analysis. Through multimodal features, traditional text readability metrics, and NLP readability indicators, this method introduces a novel approach for automatically assessing the quality of GAI-generated multimodal mathematical stories, providing a tool for grade predictor and shedding light on the factors (Image-text relevance and textual features) influencing the grade level of analyzed stories, thereby offering new insights for leveraging GAI in mathematical education.},

First, a structural equation model for a comparative study with a prior study was constructed and analyzed. Then, an extended model with the additional construct of Compatibility, which represents the alignment of AI tools with students' educational experiences and needs, was proposed and analyzed. The results demonstrated a strong influence of perceived usefulness on the intention to use GenAI, emphasizing the statistically significant role of perceived enjoyment in determining perceived usefulness and ease of use. The inclusion of compatibility improved the model's explanatory power, particularly in predicting perceived usefulness.

  abstract = {Graphs, which encode pairwise relations between entities, serve as a fundamental data structure across real-world domains. Many critical applications can be formulated as graph-based tasks, and graph machine learning (GML), from the shallow embedding models to graph neural networks and further advanced to the most powerful graph transformers, has been well-established to automate knowledge discovery and decision-making on graphs. In parallel, the recent emergence of large foundational models has driven machine learning into a new era of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI), and this revolution presents both unprecedented opportunities and profound challenges for the well-established GML paradigms. However, few investigations have analyzed and envisioned how GML should evolve to harness these opportunities, address these challenges, and embrace this new Gen-AI era. To fill in this gap, we organize the first international Workshop on Machine Learning on Graphs in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence (MLoG-GenAI), held in connection with the 31st ACM Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, which provides a venue to gather academic researchers and industry practitioners to discuss and picture the development of GML in the new Gen-AI era.},

However, it remains underexplored how GenAI chatbots influence visitors’ in-field experience and interaction at art museums regarding finding information, engagement, and enjoyment compared to existing museum tour-guide applications. In this paper, we contribute the design and implementation of a smartphone-based chatbot that detects artwork, generates textual and auditory information, and interactively answers visitors’ questions. To explore visitors’ experience with it, we conducted a field experiment (N=30) at the National Art Museum, comparing it to the existing museum application. Our results indicate that visitors showed higher artwork engagement with the chatbot than the museum application. Moreover, they enjoyed an interactive experience using the chatbot to learn about the art collection and have equally preferred textual and auditory information representation.},

  abstract = {This study analyzed how students used generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools in collaborative problem solving. We examined students’ GAI usage using conversational data and screen recordings from 12 groups, each comprising three university students. A coding framework was developed through hybrid thematic analysis to capture students’ GAI use behaviors at both individual and group levels. Four types of behaviors were identified: prompting, information sharing, information use, and evaluation. Based on this framework, we conducted a correlation analysis to examine how these behaviors were related to students’ knowledge construction. The results showed that GAI use behaviors involving sharing or comparing responses were correlated with lower levels of knowledge construction, whereas behaviors involving co-editing and evaluating were correlated with higher levels. This study contributes a new framework for analyzing individual and collective use of GAI in collaborative learning and offers pedagogical insights that guide students’ effective use of GAI tools in teaching practice.},

  abstract = {It has recently emerged that generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been significantly developed and can create realistic speech, images, and video. Although such innovations provide many advantages, they pose major threats to the network's security. The research question of the study will, therefore, be the role and effects of generative artificial intelligence on network security, especially deepfake, artificial intelligence-driven phishing, and multimedia content manipulation. This research uses a case study analysis of real-life experiences of security threats in networked systems to show how generative AI can be misused. The findings reveal that: 1. Generative AI can create highly developed cyberattacks such as deepfake social engineering and AI-supplemented phishing, which use visually and audibly persuasive appeals to manipulate users. 2. The problem with this kind of security threat highlighted by AI is that most traditional security solutions lack awareness of such threats since they are incapable of effective real-time user authentication, over-dependence on visual and biometric verification, and lack of AI-awareness training. 3. There are significant gaps in cybersecurity policies and training. Many organizations lack formal protocols for addressing AI-related security risks, and often, organizations are applying generative AI technologies. In addressing the aforementioned vulnerabilities, the study recommends an improved security model that incorporates deepfake detection, more secure authentication, and even advanced anomaly detection systems. In furtherance, there should be improvements in policy that aim at commanding the AI media, ensuring comprehensive training of the employees on cybersecurity matters, and drives that aim at educating the public on how to enhance the strength for discouraging AI cybercrimes.},

  abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems bring innovative ways of information provision and knowledge delivery. In the public sector, generative AI has the potential to decrease bureaucratic discretion in the decision-making process. Increasing reliance on this technology brings challenges of unfair treatment, colonized responses from the system, and data governance. Because of historical interaction, tribal communities are the most underrepresented in policy planning and implementation. Indigenous communities suffer from the neglect of tribal sovereignty by the U.S. federal government and limited accessibility and literacy in the digital world. Generative AI systems exacerbate these challenges with insufficient tribal input. However, the negative impact can be alleviated with digital equity and knowledge cocreation. Digital equity emphasizes the importance of tribal knowledge representation, and knowledge cocreation focuses on the collaboration between Indigenous communities and relevant actors in data governance for generative AI systems. This study proposes two research questions to discuss tribal knowledge cocreation in generative AI systems: (1) what are the biases in the system responses from the tribal perspective? (2) what are the potential resolutions for these problems? The findings from in-depth interviews with tribal members in the U.S. indicate that the insufficient articulation of tribal culture, the lack of crucial tribal historical events, and the inappropriate appellation of tribal nations are the primary drawbacks in the system responses. From the Indigenous perspective, tribal oral traditions, native publications and documents, and collaboration with tribal governments can address the problems of generative AI responses. This study contributes to the theory development of digital equity and knowledge cocreation in tribal generative AI system responses. Policy recommendations and future research agendas are included in this research.},

This alteration underlines the necessity to look into how AI can enhance ethics education for the youth. This research reveals that the capabilities of GAI match up well with the requirements of youth ethics education in four principal ways: (1) crafting immersive, multi-sensory scenarios to boost student interest. By creating such scenarios, students can get more engaged and excited about learning. (2) Employing adaptive methods for precise interventions. This means being able to adjust the teaching approach according to each student's specific situation to make the intervention more effective. (3) Generating personalized content to customize the delivery of knowledge. Every student is different, and personalized content can better meet their individual learning needs. (4) Offering real-time analysis to improve teaching methods. With real-time analysis, teachers can quickly understand how students are doing and make timely adjustments. Based on these connections, this study puts forward a framework that incorporates GAI into crucial parts of the teaching process: integrating comprehensive learning data. This helps to have a more complete understanding of students' learning progress. Developing evidence-based strategies. So that teaching decisions are made with solid evidence. Creating differentiated content. To cater to the diverse needs of students. And assessing outcomes in multiple dimensions. This integration not only enhances the efficiency of moral education but also provides a scalable model for applying AI-driven teaching innovations across different subjects.},

  abstract = {Context-aware AR instruction enables adaptive and in-situ learning experiences. However, hardware limitations and expertise requirements constrain the creation of such instructions. With recent developments in Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI), current research tries to tackle these constraints by deploying AI-generated content (AIGC) in AR applications. However, our preliminary study with six AR practitioners revealed that the current AIGC lacks contextual information to adapt to varying application scenarios and is therefore limited in authoring. To utilize the strong generative power of GenAI to ease the authoring of AR instruction while capturing the context, we developed CARING-AI, an AR system to author context-aware humanoid-avatar-based instructions with GenAI. By navigating in the environment, users naturally provide contextual information to generate humanoid-avatar animation as AR instructions that blend in the context spatially and temporally. We showcased three application scenarios of CARING-AI: Asynchronous Instructions, Remote Instructions, and Ad Hoc Instructions based on a design space of AIGC in AR Instructions. With two user studies (N=12), we assessed the system usability of CARING-AI and demonstrated the easiness and effectiveness of authoring with Gen-AI.},

We probed them to characterize their practices, and sample their attitudes, concerns, and expectations. We found that experienced designers are confident in their originality, creativity, and empathic skills, and find GenAI’s role as assistive. They emphasized the unique human factors of “enjoyment” and “agency”, where humans remain the arbiters of “AI alignment’’. However, skill degradation, job replacement, and creativity exhaustion can adversely impact junior designers. We discuss implications for human-GenAI collaboration, specifically copyright and ownership, human creativity and agency, and AI literacy and access.

However, multimodal feedback-integrating textual, auditory, and visual cues-promises a more engaging and effective learning experience. By leveraging multiple sensory channels, multimodal feedback better accommodates diverse learning preferences and aids in deeper information retention. Despite its potential, creating multimodal feedback poses challenges, including the need for increased time and resources. Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offer solutions to automate the feedback process, predominantly focusing on textual feedback. Yet, the application of GenAI in generating multimodal feedback remains largely unexplored. Our study investigates the use of GenAI techniques to generate multimodal feedback, aiming to provide this feedback for large cohorts of learners, thereby enhancing learning experience and engagement. By exploring the potential of GenAI for this purpose, we propose a framework for automating the generation of multimodal feedback, which we name MuFIN.},

  abstract = {The explosion of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has created a level of chaos in higher education as both students and faculty try to determine its utility and how best to incorporate it into the learning process. Students may view generative AI as a means to an end of achieving a perfect grade, skipping important elements of the learning process, or they may view it as an opportunity to expand their creative efforts. Faculty may view it as a tool students use to circumvent plagiarism detection, may feel it potentially minimizes the role of faculty in the classroom, or they may view it as an opportunity to avail of a supplement to existing activities and assignments. Ultimately, faculty are faced with maintaining academic integrity and reinforcing the need and importance of the learning process. This paper explores the combination of three approaches: peer-supported incremental learning, master/apprentice model, and growth mindset as a way for faculty to guide appropriate student use of generative AI, while also maintaining the integrity of the learning process.},

  abstract = {Generative AI models have revolutionized intelligent systems by enabling machines to produce human-like content across diverse domains. However, their outputs often exhibit unpredictability due to complex and opaque internal semantic states, posing challenges for reliability in real-world applications. In this article, we introduce the AI Uncertainty Principle, a novel theoretical framework inspired by quantum mechanics, to model and quantify the inherent unpredictability in generative AI outputs. By drawing parallels with the uncertainty principle and superposition, we formalize the tradeoff between the precision of internal semantic states and output variability. Through comprehensive experiments involving state-of-the-art models and a variety of prompt designs, we analyze how factors such as specificity, complexity, tone, and style influence model behavior. Our results demonstrate that carefully engineered prompts can significantly enhance output predictability and consistency, while excessive complexity or irrelevant information can increase uncertainty. We also show that ensemble techniques, such as Sigma-weighted aggregation across models and prompt variations, effectively improve reliability. Our findings have profound implications for the development of intelligent systems, emphasizing the critical role of prompt engineering and theoretical modeling in creating AI technologies that perceive, reason, and act predictably in the real world.},

  abstract = {Mathematical stories have demonstrated the ability to bolster the motivation and interest of students in learning mathematics, thereby exerting a positive influence on their academic performance. However, due to a lack of adequate resources and the desire to engage students in the creation process, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is utilized to generate mathematical stories accompanied by images. This study presents a framework for automatic quality assessment to evaluate the coherence of multimodal text and images generated by GAI, as well as the appropriateness of the stories for different grade levels. The dataset comprises mathematical stories generated by GAI for grades 3, 4, and 5, obtained from an American online learning platform, each story consisting of titles, bodies, and image illustrations generated by GP4, images generated by DALL-E3. Initially, a method is devised based on CLIP model and Mini-GPT4 for extracting multimodal semantic features to establish the relationship between text and images in mathematical stories and their generation parameters. Subsequently, mathematical text features are designed, including nine mathematical text attributes and ten traditional text readability indicators, followed by collinearity feature selection and statistical testing. Finally, five machine learning grade regressor for mathematical stories were trained, and the correlation between these 19 features and grades is explored using genetic algorithm-based factor mining and the interpretable artificial intelligence method SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). To further understand advanced text features, the latest natural language processing (NLP) readability indicators are also integrated into the analysis. Through multimodal features, traditional text readability metrics, and NLP readability indicators, this method introduces a novel approach for automatically assessing the quality of GAI-generated multimodal mathematical stories, providing a tool for grade predictor and shedding light on the factors (Image-text relevance and textual features) influencing the grade level of analyzed stories, thereby offering new insights for leveraging GAI in mathematical education.},

  abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is fundamentally changing the ways of working and blurring the boundaries between human and machine-generated contents. While there is an increasing interest in the adoption of GAI systems, such as ChatGPT and DALL-E, there are also serious concerns about the copyright of the contents—the inputs or generated as outputs by the GAI systems. Such concerns need to be identified and assessed to ensure the ethical and responsible use of GAI systems. Thus, this article aims to address the key research challenge: “how to identify and assess GAI system's copyright concerns”? In response, we propose the development of a Copyright Risk Checker (CRC) Tool. This tool has been formulated and evaluated using a recognised design science research methodology, drawing on an analysis of 10 legal cases across Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Europe. The CRC Tool has undergone evaluation through an experimental scenario, and the results suggest that it is suitable for conducting an indicative copyright risk check of GAI systems. The outcomes of this preliminary assessment can be further examined by expert legal advisors for an in-depth analysis. The development of the CRC Tool provides a foundation for continued research and advancement in this significant area of study.},

Data was collected from Finnish high school students to represent how key constructs of the Technology Acceptance Model—Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, Perceived Enjoyment, and Intention to Use—influence the adoption of AI tools. First, a structural equation model for a comparative study with a prior study was constructed and analyzed. Then, an extended model with the additional construct of Compatibility, which represents the alignment of AI tools with students' educational experiences and needs, was proposed and analyzed. The results demonstrated a strong influence of perceived usefulness on the intention to use GenAI, emphasizing the statistically significant role of perceived enjoyment in determining perceived usefulness and ease of use. The inclusion of compatibility improved the model's explanatory power, particularly in predicting perceived usefulness. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of how AI tools can be integrated into mathematics education and highlights key differences between the Finnish educational context and previous studies based on structural equation modeling.},

Based on 354 questionnaire survey data, this study systematically analyses the influencing factors and mechanisms of undergraduate students' information security in the context of generative artificial intelligence. The results show that perceived threat, subjective norms and self-efficacy have a positive influence on students' information security behaviour intention, which in turn has a positive influence on their information security behaviour implementation, with environmental support playing a moderating role between the two. The findings of the study help to further improve the theoretical model of undergraduate students' information security behaviour in the context of artificial intelligence, and at the same time provide valuable insights for education departments and colleges and universities to take effective measures to improve undergraduate students' information security capabilities in the era of generating artificial intelligence.},

This study uses topic modeling to map the research landscape of multimodal and generative AI in education. An extensive literature search yielded 4175 articles. Employing a topic modeling approach, latent topics were extracted, resulting in 38 interpretable topics organized into 14 thematic areas. Findings indicate a predominant focus on text-to-text models in educational contexts, with other modalities underexplored, overlooking the broader potential of multimodal approaches. The results suggest a research gap, stressing the importance of more balanced attention across different AI modalities and educational levels. In summary, this research provides an overview of current trends in generative AI for education, underlining opportunities for future exploration of multimodal technologies to fully realize the transformative potential of artificial intelligence in education.},

This paper critically examines the multifaceted adoption of GenAI in HE by reviewing interdisciplinary theoretical frameworks from psychology, computer science, and pedagogy. It highlights the insufficiency of traditional technology acceptance models, which predominantly address cognitive and rational decision-making processes, and advocates for the inclusion of emotional and ethical dimensions often overlooked in existing frameworks. By synthesizing research across various disciplines, this review identifies significant gaps and proposes an integrated theoretical model to effectively understand and guide GenAI adoption. The proposed framework emphasizes the need for robust, empirically supported methodologies that accommodate the complex, dynamic nature of GenAI applications. This paper not only contributes to academic discourse by providing a comprehensive review of existing literature but also sets a foundation for future empirical studies aimed at refining GenAI integration strategies in HE, ensuring they are ethically aligned and educationally effective.},

Using a comparative research methodology, the study analyzed the most recent policy documents from these regions through text-mining techniques to assess their key differences in terms of word frequency and specific content. This work highlights the different strategies, goals, and approaches to regulating generative AI across the regions. It found that the EU adopts a more comprehensive and stringent regulation of generative AI, emphasizing regional harmonization and foresight; the U.S. regulation is characterized by pragmatism, closely aligned with industry innovation, and a focus on risk avoidance; while China focuses more on macro-level regulation aimed at promoting innovation and encouraging ecological construction.Participants may be interested in this study because it not only uses up-to-date materials but also employs text-mining methods to present the findings in a clearer way than previous studies. It provides insights into how regulatory policies for generative AI affect the development and practice of digital government. The study sheds light on different countries’ strategies for technology governance, which is crucial for understanding and designing effective digital government policies. In addition, due to the potential of generative AI technologies to deliver public services and drive government transparency, these insights help participants better assess the opportunities and challenges of technological innovation in the digital government space.},

  abstract = {In computer-based learning environments (CBLEs), adopting effective self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies requires sophisticated coordination of multiple SRL processes. While various studies have proposed adaptive SRL scaffolds (i.e. real-time advice on adopting effective SRL processes) and embedded them in CBLEs to facilitate learners’ effective use of SRL strategies, two key research gaps remain. First, there is a lack of research on SRL scaffolds that are based on continuous assessment of both learners’ SRL processes and learning conditions (e.g., awareness of learning resources) to provide adaptive support. Second, current analytics-based scaffolding mechanisms lack the scalability needed to effectively address multiple learning conditions. Integration of analytics of SRL with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can provide scalable scaffolding for real-time SRL processes and evolving conditions. Yet, empirical studies implementing and evaluating effects of this integration remain scarce. To address these limitations, we conducted a randomized control trial, assigning participants to three groups (control, process only, and process with condition groups) to investigate the effects of using GenAI to turn insights from real-time analytics about students’ SRL processes and conditions into adaptive scaffolds. The results demonstrate that integrating real-time analytics with GenAI in adaptive SRL scaffolds – addressing both SRL processes and dynamic conditions – promotes more metacognitive learning patterns compared to the control and process-only groups. In addition, the learners showed varying levels of compliance with analytics-based GenAI scaffolds, and this was also reflected in how the learners coordinated their SRL processes, particularly in the performance phase of SRL. This study contributes to the literature by designing, implementing, and evaluating the impact of adaptive scaffolds on learners’ SRL processes using real-time analytics with GenAI.},

The analysis results show that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use have significant positive effects on university teachers' acceptance of generative AI. Self-efficacy, technical efficiency, organizational AI readiness and environmental support have significant positive effects on perceived usefulness. Self-efficacy, organizational AI readiness and environmental support have significant positive effects on perceived ease of use, and technical complexity has a significant negative effect. Furthermore, self-efficacy, technical efficiency, technical complexity, organizational AI readiness, and environmental support do not work independently but synergistically through different combinations, and there are three types of configurations of individual initiative type, system incubation type, and bilateral engagement type. The results of this research can help to further enrich the theoretical system of generative AI application in education, and can also provide practice suggestions for teachers, universities, and education management departments to take effective measures to enhance the acceptance of generative AI in higher education.},

In this study, a multimodal sentiment analysis framework based on generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology is proposed, aiming at automatically identifying the emotional tendency in online product marketing information. By combining the latest generative AI technology, the model can not only analyze the direct feedback from users, but also capture the potential emotional color. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional single-modal sentiment analysis method, the accuracy of the proposed multimodal model is improved by 15%, and the recall rate is improved by 12%. This shows that the model can provide more accurate market insight for enterprises, and help to better understand customer needs, improve product design and optimize marketing strategies. The demonstrated multimodal sentiment analysis framework provides a powerful tool for understanding and responding to consumer sentiment. Future research will further explore how to enhance the generalization ability of the model and how to deal with emotional differences in cross-cultural background more effectively to achieve a wider application in the global scope.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), exemplified by ChatGPT, Midjourney, and other state-of-the-art large language models and diffusion models, holds significant potential for transforming education and enhancing human productivity. While the prevalence of GenAI in education has motivated numerous research initiatives, integrating these technologies within the learning analytics (LA) cycle and their implications for practical interventions remain underexplored. This paper delves into the prospective opportunities and challenges GenAI poses for advancing LA. We present a concise overview of the current GenAI landscape and contextualise its potential roles within Clow’s generic framework of the LA cycle. We posit that GenAI can play pivotal roles in analysing unstructured data, generating synthetic learner data, enriching multimodal learner interactions, advancing interactive and explanatory analytics, and facilitating personalisation and adaptive interventions. As the lines blur between learners and GenAI tools, a renewed understanding of learners is needed. Future research can delve deep into frameworks and methodologies that advocate for human-AI collaboration. The LA community can play a pivotal role in capturing data about human and AI contributions and exploring how they can collaborate most effectively. As LA advances, it is essential to consider the pedagogical implications and broader socioeconomic impact of GenAI for ensuring an inclusive future.},

Through the bibliometric and content analysis methods, together with the CiteSpace tool, highlight the trending application of this technology in education, the distribution characteristics of the core authors and institutions' postings, and the clustering analysis of the research hotspots. The results show continued wide adoption of generative AI technology in education in recent years, peaking sharply in 2023. There hasn't been a stable core group of authors within the field, and the collaborative network is relatively sparse. Research hotspots mainly cover artificial intelligence, human-computer collaboration and educational transformation, which indicates the function generative AI technology could have within the digital transformation and quality enhancement of education. This paper additionally shows the actualization of generative AI technology through its presentation of AI tutors and teaching assistants, teaching models reform, and reshaped instructional evaluation systems via case studies. In face of misuse, integrity issues, and ethical concerns arising, there is a need to find a balance in the application of the technology, such that its more proper development can promote rather than replace human subjectivity.},

This study focuses on the behavioral intentions of elementary and secondary school teachers to use generative artificial intelligence (AIGC) to assist their teaching and its influencing factors. Based on the Integration Technology Acceptance Model (UTAUT), we analyzed the influence of factors such as performance expectations, effort expectations, social influences, and enabling conditions on primary and secondary school teachers' use of AIGC. Through questionnaire survey and data analysis, it was found that these factors have a significant effect on teachers' use of AIGC and that there are significant differences in teachers' personal characteristics such as teaching experience, gender and IT proficiency in terms of behavioral intention. In order to enhance teachers' intention to use AIGC, it is recommended to strengthen teachers' skill training, improve the quality of AIGC products, and optimize the smart teaching environment and application planning in schools.},

These tools were initially available to approximately 70 summer students, then to thousands of students online, and finally to several hundred on campus during Fall 2023. Per the course's own policy, we encouraged students to use these course-specific tools and limited the use of commercial AI software such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and the new Bing. Our goal was to approximate a 1:1 teacher-to-student ratio through software, thereby equipping students with a pedagogically-minded subject-matter expert by their side at all times, designed to guide students toward solutions rather than offer them outright. The tools were received positively by students, who noted that they felt like they had "a personal tutor.'' Our findings suggest that integrating AI thoughtfully into educational settings enhances the learning experience by providing continuous, customized support and enabling human educators to address more complex pedagogical issues. In this paper, we detail how AI tools have augmented teaching and learning in CS50, specifically in explaining code snippets, improving code style, and accurately responding to curricular and administrative queries on the course's discussion forum. Additionally, we present our methodological approach, implementation details, and guidance for those considering using these tools or AI generally in education.},

This article presents the results of a survey investigating Chinese university students' perspectives on generative artificial intelligence technologies, such as ChatGPT, in supporting their learning. It analyzes the opportunities and challenges presented by this technology. Universities need to adapt to this transformation by altering the nature of student assignments and the methods of assessment. Additionally, they must effectively leverage the advantages of students conveniently acquiring knowledge through AIGC and the opportunity for personalized tutoring across various subjects. Striking the right balance between opportunities and challenges is crucial for creating a more productive and beneficial learning environment. Ultimately, this adaptation will better prepare education for the developments and changes in the era of artificial intelligence.},

This study presents a 'Three-Tier Three-Driver' personalized teaching reform model that categorizes students into three tiers based on different career trajectories and leverages AI as a driver across three dimensions: teaching content, teaching methods, and assessment.Multiple AI tools and methods like AI teaching assistants, GPT models, knowledge graph construction, Q&amp;A modules, and AI assessment modules are used by the course to design the entire curriculum anew, boost pedagogical practice, and reconstruct assessment schemes.Data were collected from a questionnaire survey with 500 students and were modeled using K-Means clustering, DBSCAN density-based clustering algorithms and random forest models. Results demonstrate significant differences in student behaviors and perceptions related to AI tool usage across the different clusters.Effective use of AI technologies was found to benefit student satisfaction and academic performance. Furthermore, there was a significant association found between AI use times and course satisfaction, however DBSCAN could not detect a group of extreme learners.The study concludes by compiling replicable evidence of AI-driven teaching innovation and discussing existing limitations (such as the limited sample scope) as well as possible directions for future work.The conclusion uncovers GAI-empowered teaching innovation as a good promise for teaching quality improvement and personalized learning promotion for postgraduate education.},

A key question, then, is whether people believe news headlines generated by AI as much as news headlines generated by humans. AI is viewed as lacking human motives and emotions, suggesting that people might view news written by AI as more accurate. By contrast, two pre-registered experiments on representative U.S. samples (N = 4,034) showed that people rated news headlines written by AI as less accurate than those written by humans. People were more likely to incorrectly rate news headlines written by AI (vs. a human) as inaccurate when they were actually true, and more likely to correctly rate them as inaccurate when they were indeed false. Our findings are important given the increasing adoption of AI in news generation, and the associated ethical and governance pressures to disclose it use and address standards of transparency and accountability.},

Both physical and digital prototypes are commonly adopted by designers to support ideation and creativity, providing intuitive perception and rapid iteration, respectively. In recent advancements, large-scale generation models are able to offer data-enabled creativity support by generating high-quality solutions comparable to human designers. This opens up an imaginary space for designers and brings new possibilities for design tools. In this study, we proposed a hybrid prototype method that synergistically combines physical models and generative artificial intelligence (AI) in the conceptual design stage. Correspondingly, we developed a hybrid prototype system to implement the proposed method. We conducted a comparative user study with 45 designers who completed a design task using the physical prototype method, standalone generative AI and the hybrid prototype method, respectively. Our results verified the effectiveness of the hybrid prototype method and investigated its mechanism in supporting creativity. Finally, we discussed the application value and optimisation space of the hybrid prototype method.},

Therefore, based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Self-Determination Theory (SDT), this study adopts the method of structural equation model to deeply understand the influencing factors of college students' dishonest behaviors in online learning under the background of generative artificial intelligence. The results show that attitude, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norm all have a significant positive impact on behavior intention of dishonesty when online learning. Specifically, the attitude of dishonest behaviors in online learning is influenced by autonomous motivation (e.g., intrinsic interest, self-improvement) and controlled motivation (e.g., external rewards, avoidance of punishments); perceived behavioral control is influenced by autonomous motivation, controlled motivation, and moral obligation; and the subjective norm is not only affected by autonomous motivation but also by moral obligation. Based on this, this study proposes some interventions to mitigate dishonest behaviors in online learning to create a good learning atmosphere for the online learning environment.},

Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has begun to attract interest for its potential to address longstanding barriers to access. However, little is known about the impact of these tools on the living and learning experiences of post-secondary students with disabilities. As a mixed-abilities team, we investigated student experiences with GenAI tools by collecting survey and interview responses from 62 and 21 students with disabilities, respectively, across two universities to measure students’ use of GenAI tools and their perspectives on the impact of these tools in ways related to disability, university support, and sense of belonging. Despite concerns over potential risks of GenAI and unclear university policies, students described GenAI tools as a useful resource for personalizing learning, promoting self-care, and assisting with important self-advocacy work. Guidance demonstrating safe, acceptable uses of GenAI tools, along with clear policies and resources that acknowledge diverse student needs, were desired. We discuss implications of these tools for accessibility and inclusion in higher education.},

With the continuous updates and iterations of web front-end development technology, how to improve learners' practical abilities and development efficiency has become an important issue in the field of vocational education. Therefore, we have designed an innovative web front-end development course training platform that combines the automation generation ability of generative artificial intelligence and the fast construction advantage of low code development. In platform design, we fully utilize the automated generation capability of generative artificial intelligence to achieve intelligent generation and layout optimization of front-end page elements. At the same time, with the help of the visual programming interface and component-based development methods of low code development platforms, the front-end development process is simplified, the technical threshold is lowered, and students can focus more on the implementation of business logic and creative expression.},

  abstract = {In the face of the high requirements of vocational education for practical skills training, as well as the poor results and high costs of traditional training, this study aims to build an efficient and intelligent virtual training and simulation operation platform by introducing generative artificial intelligence technology to improve teaching quality and learning efficiency. This paper uses the adversarial generation ability of GAN and combines it with the knowledge graph in the field of vocational education to generate a high-fidelity and scalable virtual training environment. The variational autoencoder (VAE) is used to dynamically adjust the scene parameters to adapt to the needs of different majors and skill levels. Based on the Transformer multimodal dialogue model, a real-time operation guidance system integrating virtual and real is constructed. The physical engine is combined to simulate the feedback of equipment operation, and the long short-term memory network (LSTM) is used to capture the characteristics of the trainee's operation sequence, dynamically predict potential errors and trigger correction prompts. This paper also uses the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to build a personalized evaluation agent, using the trainee's operation data as the state space to generate targeted training suggestions. The average operation accuracy of the experimental group students reaches 89.715%, the highest skill assessment pass rate reaches 100%, and the overall distribution is more concentrated, reducing the cost of practical training. In addition, teachers and students highly evaluated the teaching adaptability, operation guidance and error correction functions of the platform. The teaching platform proposed in this study provides a new path and strategy for the modernization of vocational education.},

Integrating generative AI images into design education has become an inevitable trend, as it guides students in developing a deeper understanding of design aesthetics. However, the current application of generative AI images in design education lacks innovative use grounded in design theory. Therefore, the incorporation of generative AI images within the framework of design theory becomes crucial to interpret and refine design processes and design thinking. This research aims to explore the application of generative AI images in design semiotics, utilizing design theory as its foundation. By integrating design processes and incorporating design case studies, the study seeks to analyze how generative AI images can be effectively applied in design semiotics.

  abstract = {Chinese martial arts are deeply rooted in the traditional culture of the Chinese nation. Throughout its historical development, it has accumulated a profound historical heritage and formed its unique cultural value. The technological innovation of generative artificial intelligence provides a new path for the modernization transformation of Chinese martial arts culture. This study proposes a framework for Chinese martial arts cultural products based on generative artificial intelligence and multimodal interaction. By combining deep learning models (such as GANs, Transformers) with blockchain and AR/VR technology, five applications were designed: technology-enabled martial arts digital products, martial arts interactive short videos, martial arts motion capture systems, martial arts education platforms, and martial arts virtual experience halls. These applications were evaluated and validated from the dimensions of user experience and market potential. Experimental results show that martial arts cultural products under generative artificial intelligence and multimodal interaction have good user experience and positive market prospects, providing theoretical and practical reference for the deep integration of martial arts culture and intelligent technology.},

This paper presents a scoping review that explores the current understanding of integrating generative artificial intelligence tools in the learning of introductory programming. Through an analysis of 28 selected studies, this review provides a snapshot of the landscape in mid-2024, presenting benefits, concerns, and recommendations surrounding the use of generative artificial intelligence within programming education. It finds insufficient guidance on how to implement recommended pedagogical strategies, limited consideration of student perceptions and experiences, and a predominance of short study time frames. Additionally, there is a significant research gap in second-level education, particularly in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The paper discusses how these gaps signal a need for more human-centered approaches in the current research. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research, aiming to inspire further inquiry and advance the understanding of generative artificial intelligence’s role in programming education from a human-centered perspective.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) technology, its application in the field of education has gradually become an important direction of teaching reform. This paper takes the course of “Java Framework Application “in software technology major as the research object, discusses how to empower the traditional teaching mode through AIGC technology, and improve the teaching quality and practical effect of the course. Firstly, the pain points existing in the current Java framework course teaching were analyzed, including the shortage of case resources, the single practice scene, and the lack of personalized guidance. Secondly, combined with the technical characteristics of AIGC, a multi-dimensional application model covering code generation, intelligent question answering, scene simulation and learning effect evaluation was constructed. By introducing a large language model to automatically generate customized case codes of mainstream frameworks such as Spring Boot and MyBatis, conversational AI is used to assist students to solve development problems in real time, and a virtual project scene is constructed based on generative technology to strengthen engineering practice ability. Teaching practice shows that the application of AIGC technology greatly improves students 'code standardization and project development efficiency, and teachers can accurately locate learning weaknesses through intelligent analysis tools. This study provides a reusable implementation path for the intelligent transformation of technology courses, and verifies the empowering value of generative artificial intelligence in the field of vocational education, which has important reference significance for the optimization of future curriculum system.},

This submission presents a systematic review of 95 case studies, 64 in education, 14 in arts, and 17 in heritage — selected via a PRISMA-guided search and expert screening — to map how generative artificial intelligence is embedded at both the interface and interaction levels. We identify nine interface archetypes (e.g., conversational, adaptive dashboards, immersive environments interfaces), eight interaction patterns (e.g., conversing, collaborating, manipulating),and eight main user experience dimensions as observed in case studies. Our analysis further categorizes six modality-usage patterns—from text, image, audio, and video up to fully multi-modal workflows and distillsfour main categories of end-to-end application pipelines. Notably, only two studies were found to articulate design-phase guidelines, and limitations cluster around output quality, ethical risks, and a lack of longitudinal evaluations. We conclude with limitations observed and future research focused on explainability, participatory design, and sustained field deployments. This synthesis provides a foundation for researchers and practitioners seeking to harness generative artificial intelligence as a responsive, human-centered collaborator.},

However, existing image-based methods generate results with blurred boundaries, graphic-based methods produce results with poor diversity, and rendering-based methods synthesize inconsistent images. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a novel controllable 3D urban generation pipeline, which consists of urban layouts and 3D scenes generation. Specifically, we introduce the graph dynamic attention model and the dummy node to enhance the diversity of the generated results. We also design a scene asset matching method based on the CLIP model to controllably generate 3D urban scenes. Experimental results indicate that the diversity of the generated results surpasses that of existing methods, and the generated 3D urban scenes are of good consistency.},

The study reports the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Variational Autocoders (VAE) in artistic style extraction from a large number of datasets and generating innovative images with regional cultural features. The study draws from cultural anthropology's "Three Elements of Culture Theory" in examining the material, organizational and spiritual dimensions. The study identifies three methods of cultural translation: direct translation, consecutive translation, and indirect translation. The study utilizes these frameworks in examining innovative solutions to expressing Henan's regional culture in modern cultural products. It demonstrates how to achieve cultural dissemination and inheritance and enhance cultural identity and global influence in the context of globalization. The study also examines the potential of AI-based image generation in cultural creative design, thus offering a new framework for perceiving and examining the role of computer technology in cultural translation and innovation.},

It is important to investigate how special education teachers perceive and use GAI for two distinct instructional tasks: instructional enrichment and accommodations. Although the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) has been extensively used to study technology adoption, its application to GAI in special education is underrepresented. This gap is critical as special education teachers must address diverse needs of students with multiple disabilities. Moreover, limited research had examined how TAM dimensions vary across different tasks. This late-breaking study revealed that teachers consistently rated GAI lower for accommodations across all TAM dimensions, with particularly differences in Intention to Use and Actual Use. The results highlighted the complexities of adopting GAI for distinct instructional purposes. Although GAI demonstrated potential for supporting instructional enrichment, its inability to generate individualized recommendations limited its effectiveness for accommodations.},

This study commences with the industry perturbation instigated by the DeepSeek large - model to explore the interactive mechanisms between financial public opinion and capital markets during technological innovation events. Through the comprehensive utilization of methods such as literature review, case analysis, social network analysis, and regression analysis, and drawing on 12,329 Weibo public opinion data points and high - frequency trading data from 16 A - share DeepSeek concept stocks, a novel “technology decoding – market response” dual - path model is constructed. The study reveals that technology - related public opinion gradually infiltrates the financial domain via a three - stage progression: “professional decoding – industry restructuring – investment decision - making.” Technology bloggers assume a pivotal role in information dissemination, as evidenced by an intermediary centrality of 0.29. The data further indicate that for each one - standard - deviation increment in public opinion intensity, the excess return of concept stocks surges by 1.8% after 36 hours (p = 0.03), whereas the impact of sentiment polarity on stock prices is not statistically significant (β = 0.04, p = 0.41).Adopting an integrated perspective from journalism and behavioral finance, this research elucidates the propagation patterns of technology - related public opinion and its inherent connections with capital markets, and it formulates a “technology–finance” public opinion governance framework. These findings provide crucial theoretical underpinnings and practical guidelines for the prevention of financial risks associated with technology - related public opinion, thereby having far - reaching implications for optimizing financial market regulation and enhancing public opinion management systems.},

We use literature-review based conceptual analysis with abductive reasoning to propose the new concept that addresses identified limitations in existing systems. The paper explores the emergence of GAEs as a leap from expert systems. We name two enablers for GAEs - ongoing development of a research field of human-AI collaboration and growing capabilities of generative artificial intelligence systems. We discuss existing generative AI agents, noting that GAEs as such do not exist yet, but are starting to emerge. Due conceptual nature of this paper we do not explore the technical aspects of GAEs development.

To aid in this effort, we designed an open-ended generative AI project for the freshmen taking our general-education introduction to computing course. Students were required to team with generative AI to create something beyond what they alone (or the AI alone) could accomplish. Upon completion, students submitted a short written critical analysis documenting their experiences and presented a three-minute demonstration of their project in class. Despite limited course coverage of AI and generative AI prior to this project, we were impressed by the creativity and sophistication of the submitted final products as well as the breadth of generative AI tools explored. Student reflections on the experience illustrated numerous insights into the strengths and limitations of the tools they employed. Our results underscore that students can learn about the benefits and limitations of generative AI in as little as a single assignment and that covering such topics need not require extensive amounts of course time and resources.},

These concerns are addressed through themes such as attribution transparency, the ethics of relying on non-human solutions and balancing inspiration versus imitation. The pictorial shares extracts from a two-year digital sketchbook that reflects how GAI can support artists in times of crisis and contributes to broader conversations about GAI's role in art practice. It invites readers to consider the evolving relationship between artists and GAI in shaping the future of art practice.},

In this paper, we investigate the application of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) to personalize our virtual spaces and enhance the metaverse experience. To this end, we present a pipeline to enable users to customize their virtual spaces. Moreover, we explore the hardware resources and latency required for personalized spaces, as well as user acceptance of the AI-generated spaces. Comprehensive user studies follow extensive system experiments. Our research evaluates users' perceptions of two generated spaces: panoramic images and 3D virtual spaces. According to our findings, users have shown a great interest in 3D personalized spaces, and the practicality and immersion of 3D space generation tools surpass panoramic space generation tools.},

  abstract = {Medical image analysis is essential for accurate disease diagnosis, with multimodal imaging offering complementary information to enhance diagnostic precision. However, current GAN architectures exhibit limitations in feature fusion efficiency, synthesized image quality, and classification accuracy. In this study, a GAN-based multimodal medical image generation and classification model was constructed. First, features are extracted using multi-scale receptive fields, key channels are enhanced by combining the channel attention mechanism, and the cross-enhanced fusion module realizes the fusion of MRI and PET features. In addition, Generator 3D is responsible for generating realistic medical images and classifying diseases through the classification header. Discriminator 3D is used to discriminate the realism of the images. Meanwhile, a comprehensive loss function is designed to optimize the generator's performance by combining adversarial loss, correlation loss, mean loss, and classification loss. The experimental results show that the proposed method can generate high-quality medical images and perform well on the classification task. It effectively improves the performance of medical image analysis and provides strong support for clinical diagnosis.},

This makes it bad at telling the important features and not good at working with different design cases.This study tries to make generative AI better at designing Wind-Responsive Passive Building Facades by using the K-means clustering algorithm.First, this study built a dataset with facade images, weather conditions, material types, and size info. Then, using the K-means clustering algorithm, we picked out key features and grouped the buildings by type. The goal is to give generative AI a better kind of visual data to learn from.Based on that, we made a three-level prompt structure to help generative AI work better with different design tasks.This study not only builds a clear method between finding building features and making prompts, but also gives ideas and steps for using generative AI more in sustainable building design.},

Computer science student perceptions and behaviors towards GenAI tools have been studied, but the effects of such tools on student learning have yet to be determined conclusively. We investigate the impact of GenAI tools on computing students' performance in a database course and aim to understand why students use GenAI tools in assignments. Our mixed-methods study (N=226) asked students to self-report whether they used a GenAI tool to complete a part of an assignment and why. Our results reveal that students utilizing GenAI tools performed better on the assignment part in which LLMs were permitted but did worse in other parts of the assignment and in the course overall. Also, those who did not use GenAI tools viewed more discussion board posts and participated more than those who used ChatGPT. This suggests that using GenAI tools may not lead to better skill development or mental models, at least not if the use of such tools is unsupervised, and that engagement with official course help supports may be affected. Further, our thematic analysis of reasons for using or not using GenAI tools, helps understand why students are drawn to these tools. Shedding light into such aspects empowers instructors to be proactive in how to encourage, supervise, and handle the use or integration of GenAI into courses, fostering good learning habits.},

However, assisting in creative tasks without getting in the way of the artist’s workflow can be challenging. Since there is no "correct" answer in creative works for the machine to steer towards, the machine must gauge the "goodness" or "badness" of its actions by watching the user’s response. We present our system, ‘Hero’, for eliciting and developing interactions around creative machines, particularly drawing machines. It uses multi-modal information about the user to steer when it should intervene in the creative process. We are using this system in user studies and interviews with artists to understand what modalities they would use to interact with and give feedback to a machine without disrupting their usual sense of creative workflow. This paper outlines this project’s background, Hero’s current system design, ongoing user experiments, and our planned future work to develop a mixed-initiative, multi-modal collaborative machine for creative tasks.

  abstract = {The curricular design of programs in Higher Education is increasingly oriented towards competence-based learning goals in order to provide more specific and explicit qualifications. At the same time the descriptions of competences are mostly based on textual descriptions often in informal style targeted towards different audiences making descriptions vague and harder to compare. Formal models for the specification of competences exist for some time and even semantic models are being developed, e.g., the European Learning Model. These different approaches lead to a gap between formal and informal competence descriptions that require manual efforts of curriculum designer to maintain. This research borrows the concept of Deep and Surface representation models from the field of linguistics to unify the different approaches. Additionally, it focuses on the functionality of Generative Artificial Intelligence in the form of Large Language Models to close the aforementioned gap. It demonstrates the potential of the technology in both directions and discusses application potential of the concept.},

  abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) offers numerous opportunities to revolutionise teaching and learning in Computing Education (CE). However, educators have expressed concerns that students may over-rely on GenAI and use these tools to generate solutions without engaging in the learning process. While substantial research has explored GenAI use in CE, and many Computer Science (CS) educators have expressed their opinions and suggestions on the subject, there remains little consensus on implementing curricula and assessment changes.In this paper, we describe our experiences with using GenAI in CS-focused educational settings and the changes we have implemented accordingly in our teaching in recent years since the popularisation of GenAI. From our experiences, we propose two primary actions for the CE community: 1) redesign take-home assignments to incorporate GenAI use and assess students on their process of using GenAI to solve a task rather than simply on the final product; 2) redefine the role of educators to emphasise metacognitive aspects of learning, such as critical thinking and self-evaluation. This paper presents and discusses these stances and outlines several practical methods to implement these strategies in CS classrooms. Then, we advocate for more research addressing the concrete impacts of GenAI on CE, especially those evaluating the validity and effectiveness of new teaching practices.},

  abstract = {With the increasing integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into cultural heritage dissemination, users' digital interactions in museums have evolved from passive information reception to active co-creation. To investigate the mechanisms through which GenAI usability influences user enjoyment, this study applies the Hedonic Motivation System Adoption Model (HMSAM) and develops a theoretical framework incorporating six mediating constructs: perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, curiosity, joy, sense of control, and immersion. Based on 582 valid responses collected from the “Cloud Tour of Dunhuang” digital heritage initiative, structural equation modeling was conducted using SmartPLS 4.0. The findings reveal that GenAI usability does not directly affect users' enjoyment; instead, its influence is transmitted indirectly through several psychological mediators. Specifically, GenAI usability significantly enhances perceived ease of use, usefulness, curiosity, joy, and control, each of which contributes to users’ enjoyment, with joy demonstrating the strongest mediating effect. Although GenAI usability also increases users’ sense of immersion, immersion itself does not significantly predict enjoyment. These results extend the applicability of HMSAM in the cultural technology domain, deepen the theoretical understanding of user behavior in smart museums, and offer practical guidance for optimizing GenAI-based interactive system design in cultural heritage contexts.},

The results show that when the number of principal components is 3, the cumulative contribution rate of the principal components reaches 86.483%, and the contribution rates of the three principal components are 65.084%, 11.702%, 9.097%, and the eigenvalues of the three principal components are all greater than 1. Then the three principal components are used as the input layer to build the compressive strength model of cemented gravel based on PCA-BPNN, and the RMSEs of the training set and test set are 0.253 and 0.28, respectively. The RMSE of the training set and the test set are 0.253 and 0.286, and the R2 is 0.947 and 0.942, which are not much different from the BPNN model with the number of nodes in the input layer of 6 and 11 before dimensionality reduction, and they are obviously better than the BPNN model in the convergence speed and training time. It can be seen that the PCA-BPNN model has good prediction effect and prediction efficiency, especially drastically reducing the training time, which provides a new idea for the prediction research of the mechanical properties of cemented gravel.},

  abstract = {The emergence of foundational models and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is poised to transform productivity in scientific computing, especially in code development, refactoring, and translating from one programming language to another. However, because the output of GenAI cannot be guaranteed to be correct, manual intervention remains necessary. Some of this intervention can be automated through task-specific tools, alongside additional methodologies for correctness verification and effective prompt development. We explored the application of GenAI in assisting with code translation, language interoperability, and codebase inspection within a legacy Fortran codebase used to simulate particle interactions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the process, we developed a tool, CodeScribe, which combines prompt engineering with user supervision to establish an efficient process for code conversion. In this paper, we demonstrate how CodeScribe assists in converting Fortran code to C++, generating Fortran-C APIs for integrating legacy systems with modern C++ libraries, and providing developer support for code organization and algorithm implementation. We also address the challenges of AI-driven code translation and highlight its benefits for enhancing productivity in scientific computing workflows.},

  abstract = {Multimodal MRI synthesis is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning, particularly in glioma segmentation. However, cross-subject synthesis faces significant challenges due to the variability in brain structures and tumor morphology across individuals. Existing methods often fail to preserve tumor region fidelity, limiting their practical utility. To address these limitations, we propose the Tumor Representation Consistency Alignment Generative Adversarial Network (TRCA-GAN), a novel framework designed to enhance tumor region fidelity in cross-subject multimodal MRI synthesis. TRCA-GAN introduces two key innovations: the Region-Aware Perturbation Module (RAPM), which enhances tumor structure preservation through adaptive perturbation and joint attention mechanisms, and the Local Contrast Discriminator Module (LCDM), which improves tumor contrast fidelity via a dual physical-feature constraint mechanism. Extensive experiments on the BraTS2021 dataset demonstrate that TRCA-GAN significantly outperforms comparison methods in terms of image generation quality and tumor segmentation accuracy. The results highlight the effectiveness of TRCA-GAN in addressing the challenges of cross-subject MRI synthesis, making it a powerful tool for clinical applications.},

As GenAI integration in higher education grows, understanding its influence on critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity is essential. Using a mixed-effects model, we synthesized data from quantitative studies to explore two moderators: cognitive skill level (e.g., understanding, applying, analyzing) and instructional context (instructed vs. unguided use). Our findings indicate that GenAI tools significantly enhance lower-order cognitive outcomes, particularly in understanding and applying concepts, with instructed use producing stronger positive effects than unguided use. However, their impact on higher-order cognitive skills, such as creating and evaluating, was minimal. These results highlight the importance of tailoring GenAI integration to task complexity and underscore the value of guided instruction in maximizing its educational benefits. Educators should prioritize instructional strategies that encourage active engagement with GenAI tools, particularly for fostering critical thinking and creativity.},

This paper presents a technique for developing personalized dialogue in intelligent customer service applications to the insurance business. Our model establishes an insurance knowledge base and utilizes the retrieval-augmented generation approach. In addition, we create dynamic memory by connecting the long short-term memory module, allowing the system to retrieve and modify customer's information while interacting with them in real time. As a result, intelligent models offer much more natural and engaging conversations, adjusting to specific tones and retaining individual emotions. These virtual assistants customize the responses according to the customer profiles. Hence, they give appropriate, professional, and personalized insurance advice.},

While these tools promise to enhance programmer productivity, their impact on Time-Constrained Coding Challenges (TCCs), such as competitive programming, hackathons, and technical interviews remains poorly understood. TCCs are fundamental to both educational assessment and professional recruitment in software engineering. Integrating GenAI tools in these environments raises critical questions about skill development, assessment validity, and the nature of programming expertise. Current research lacks a systematic understanding of how GenAI tools influence programmer performance and learning outcomes in time-constrained environments. This gap is particularly concerning as educational institutions and industry organizations struggle to establish guidelines for GenAI use in TCCs. Without proper frameworks for integration, there are risks of: (1) Over-reliance on AI, potentially compromising fundamental skill development, and (2) Misalignment between traditional evaluation metrics and emerging co-intelligent programming practices.

  abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, its application in the field of language culture and visual presentation has attracted widespread attention. As an important part of China's regional culture, the dialects of Sichuan and Chongqing have unique phonetic, lexical and grammatical characteristics. However, with the advancement of modernization, the inheritance and revitalization of the dialects of Sichuan and Chongqing face many challenges. This paper takes the visual transformation of the dialects of Sichuan and Chongqing as the research object, and explores how to integrate artificial intelligence technology into the workshop design strategy with the visual transformation of the dialects of Sichuan and Chongqing as the research object, so as to achieve the symbolic translation and multi-dimensional visualization presentation of the dialects. The study first extracted the representative vocabulary of the dialects of Sichuan and Chongqing and analyzed their visual transformation needs. Combining the advantages of artificial intelligence technology, the action research method was used to establish a workshop based on a multimodal transformation framework such as speech recognition and image generation. Through case analysis and practical verification, this paper demonstrates the application effect of artificial intelligence technology in the dialect visual transformation workshop, including the visualization of dialect words, the visualization of dialect stories, and the interactive experience of dialect culture. The research conclusion is: the icons generated by generative artificial intelligence integrated into the visual transformation of dialects can be seen to have more concrete symbols and fewer symbolic symbols. These will gradually change as the participants are "tamed" by artificial intelligence. In the graphic symbols generated by combining symbols, we can find two types of combination: international symbols and regional symbols. This provides an experimental paradigm for the design with dialect as the carrier, and also provides a reference for the discussion of the spread and regeneration of dialect.},

Deep Convolutional Networks (DCN) have emerged as practical tools in addressing these challenges, particularly in skin cancer diagnosis. The research aims to explore the performance of various neural networks in skin cancer recognition, assessing metrics such as accuracy (ACC), Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), and Area Under the Curve (AUC). The study uses modified DCN classifiers, namely ResNet50, InceptionV3, and DenseNet121, on the HAM10000 dataset. The results demonstrate that the modified InceptionV3 exhibited high performance compared to other networks, achieving a weighted accuracy of 86.58% and a weighted ROC of 0.96.

The study concludes that DCN provides a reliable framework for automating melanoma diagnosis and expediting identification, potentially saving lives. The paper also delves into the dataset preprocessing, model optimization strategies, and detailed performance analysis of the modified models. Key findings include the superior performance of the modified InceptionV3 in skin cancer classification and its potential to enhance early skin cancer detection, aligning with developing an efficient melanoma detection method.},

  abstract = {Technological intervention to support care areas that some people may not have access to is of paramount importance to promote sustainable development of good health and wellbeing. This study aims to explore the linguistic similarities and differences between human professionals and Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) conversational agents in therapeutic dialogues. Initially, the MISTRAL-7B Large Language Model (LLM) is instructed to generate responses to patient queries to form a synthetic equivalent to a publicly available psychology dataset. A large set of linguistic features (e.g., text metrics, lexical diversity and richness, readability scores, sentiment, emotions, and named entities) is extracted and studied from both the expert and synthetically-generated text. The results suggest a significantly richer vocabulary in humans than the LLM approach. Similarly, the use of sentiment was significantly different between the two, suggesting a difference in the supportive or objective language used and that synthetic linguistic expressions of emotion may differ from those expressed by an intelligent being. However, no statistical significance was observed between human professionals and AI in the use of function words, pronouns and several named entities; possibly reflecting an increased proficiency of LLMs in modelling some language patterns, even in a specialised context (i.e., therapy). However, current findings do not support the similarity in sentimental nuance and emotional expression, which limits the effectiveness of contemporary LLMs as standalone agents. Further development is needed towards clinically validated algorithms.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is versatile for various applications, but security and privacy concerns with third-party AI vendors hinder its broader adoption in sensitive scenarios. Hence, it is essential for users to validate the AI trustworthiness and ensure the security of data boundaries. In this paper, we present a dye testing system named Dye4AI, which injects crafted trigger data into human-AI dialogue and observes AI responses towards specific prompts to diagnose data flow in AI model evolution. Our dye testing procedure contains 3 stages: trigger generation, trigger insertion, and trigger retrieval. First, to retain both uniqueness and stealthiness, we design a new trigger that transforms a pseudo-random number to a intelligible format. Second, with a custom-designed three-step conversation strategy, we insert each trigger item into dialogue and confirm the model memorizes the new trigger knowledge in the current session. Finally, we routinely try to recover triggers with specific prompts in new sessions, as triggers can present in new sessions only if AI vendors leverage user data for model fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on six LLMs demonstrate our dye testing scheme is effective in ensuring the data boundary, even for models with various architectures and parameter sizes. Also, larger and premier models tend to be more suitable for Dye4AI, e.g., trigger can be retrieved in OpenLLaMa-13B even with only 2 insertions per trigger item. Moreover, we analyze the prompt selection in dye testing, providing insights for future testing systems on generative AI services.},

This article provides an evaluation method for the leakage problem of underground pipeline networks based on BP neural network algorithm and genetic algorithm, which is based on historical accident type data, time data, and regional feature data of accident points. The data is then processed and transformed into neural network model data, which is then trained and verified by the neural network model. The results have shown that this method can not only make predictions before water pipe leakage or even explosion accidents occur, but also provide accurate and effective guidance for daily pipeline inspections, and improve work efficiency.

With the rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) technologies in areas like image generation and natural language processing, generative AI has also played a crucial role in addressing key issues in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), such as data sparsity, difficulty in observing abnormal scenarios, and in modeling data uncertainty. In this review, we systematically investigate the relevant literature on generative AI techniques in addressing key issues in different types of tasks in ITS tailored specifically for road transportation. First, we introduce the principles of different generative AI techniques. Then, we classify tasks in ITS into four types: traffic perception, traffic prediction, traffic simulation, and traffic decision-making. We systematically illustrate how generative AI techniques addresses key issues in these four different types of tasks. Finally, we summarize the challenges faced in applying generative AI to ITS, and discuss future research directions based on different application scenarios.},

Algorithms that do not depend on paired data have significant practical significance. In order to achieve the style transfer between Chinese ink paintings and Van Gogh's artworks, this paper introduces a self-made new dataset and implements the transformation between these two artistic styles based on the CycleGAN network model. Furthermore, through methods such as data augmentation and learning rate adjustment, this study extensively explores the key factors affecting the learning process of the adversarial loss function in CycleGAN. The results reveal that augmenting the self-made dataset through data enhancement techniques, such as adding noise and color transformations, can enhance the robustness of the model. Additionally, employing the "learning rate warm-up" strategy effectively updates parameters during training, leading to better fitting to the optimal solution.},

  abstract = {In response to the problem of complex visual feature categories and sparse datasets for related refined categories in traffic accidents, this article has created a traffic accident target detection dataset, the AccOD dataset, which is divided into five categories. This dataset can serve as a benchmark for training and evaluating traffic accident target detection algorithms. Aiming at the real-time, accuracy, and intelligence issues of traffic accident detection, an improved traffic accident target detection network based on YOLOv8 is proposed. This network replaces a more efficient backbone network structure and improves the downsampling module that integrates different scale features in the head network, reducing the number of model parameters and computational complexity while improving the detection accuracy of the model. The C2f module is improved to balance various contextual information, further enhancing the detection ability of the model. The experiment showed that the improved model achieved a 4.75% improvement in mAP0.5 and 4.58% improvement in mAP0.5:0.95 on the AccOD dataset compared to YOLOv8n, and a 2.14% improvement in mAP0.5 and 6.23% improvement in mAP0.5:0.95 on the open source ACD dataset. This algorithm improves the detection accuracy of traffic accidents and maintains the lightweight of the model, providing an effective method for intelligent traffic accident detection.},

The historical trends of these strongly correlated sectors are extracted, and a joint forecasting model based on Long Short-term Memory Networks (LSTM) is established. Multi-dimensional time-series features are extracted to predict the future trend changes of specific sector indices. Experimental results demonstrate that the model achieves effective results in predicting the trends of some industry sectors, obtaining weighted F1 score greater than 0.75 for multiple industry sectors such as Automotive Services and Energy Metals. The findings of this study suggest that leveraging industry sector correlations can enhance the accuracy and reliability of index trend forecasting, albeit with attention required to market risks and model errors in practical applications.

To alleviate these problems, this paper proposes an automated system to generate multi-modal perception data (image, point cloud, vehicle status) by synthesizing diverse 3D scenes within a simulation platform. By directly constructing 3D scene models, the system eliminates perspective inconsistencies inherent in rendering-based methods.

This study investigates the integration of generative AI, specifically ChatGPT-powered conversational modules, into two social robots, Nao and Buddy, to evaluate their impact on the social communication skills, reasoning abilities, and educational engagement of children with ASD. Following a prospective design, interviews with educators identified the needs and objectives pertinent to the children. These insights informed the development of contextualized prompts and interaction scenarios. Experimental pedagogical sessions will be conducted in classroom settings with fifty children aged 8 to 14 years diagnosed with ASD. Qualitative observations and quantitative assessments will be employed to analyze engagement levels, communicative behaviors, and problem-solving skills during child-robot interactions. Preliminary findings aim to assess how AI-enhanced robots can foster greater conversational engagement, improved social reciprocity, and increased motivation for educational tasks. The study underscores the potential of combining social robotics with generative AI to support the autonomy and inclusion of neurodivergent learners.

This requires fine-tuning with high-quality data. Extraction of question-answer (QA) pairs from domain knowledge documents is a crucial prerequisite for fine-tuning, especially when these documents containing complex charts and unstructured data. This paper introduces a framework for extracting QA pairs from charts, which combines OCR and VLM to fully leverage contextual information in the documents and generate deep, contextually relevant questions. Our method first uses OCR for initial chart recognition, followed by a VLM-based “Caption-Reflection'' paradigm to reduce misrecognition. We then design a context localization module which combines local and global contexts to generate relevant QA pairs. Additionally, we construct a specialized chart knowledge base to guide the generation of QA pairs. Experimental results show significant improvement in both chart recognition performance and QA pairs generation quality: the average precision increases from 0.52 to 0.90, the average F1 Score improves from 0.64 to 0.94, the average FPR decreases from 0.55 to 0 respectively.

  abstract = {Academic writing is one of the most important tasks in Academia. The pressure to "publish or perish" drives researchers to use all the tools available to try to improve their papers and their impact. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) that can create content such as text, tables, and images can be used for many tasks in academic writing such as summarizing, translating, paraphrasing, data analysis, and presentation. Therefore, AI is expected to be widely used in academic writing in the near future and have a significant impact. Understanding this impact is far from trivial and needs to be carefully studied. The first step in doing so is to be able to identify papers written with the help of AI tools. This can be done by adding metadata on the use of AI in academic results. In this paper, we embark on an initial endeavor to devise such metadata and delineate the potential advantages that the inclusion of AI-related metadata in academic publications may bring forth.},

  abstract = {The rise of deepfake technologies has introduced powerful tools for synthetic face generation, which is often associated with manipulation and privacy violations. However, recently, these generative techniques are repurposed for privacy-preserving applications. This paper presents a structured review of facial anonymization methods that leverage generative models to conceal identity while preserving semantic features, such as expressions and poses. We analyze seven representative studies, comparing their model architectures, alignment with deepfake transformation types, evaluation metrics, and application scenarios. Our review identifies a range of promising technical strategies with particular attention to how recent approaches address demographic fairness, face and body anonymization, and real-world deployment challenges. We underscore the importance of ethically sourced data and policy-aware designs as prerequisites for responsible use. By positioning facial de-identification not only as a technical challenge but also as a sociotechnical necessity, this review outlines a research agenda centered on the privacy, utility, and equitable adoption of generative artificial intelligence systems.},

  abstract = {Usually, a soil profile ruler is located vertically on a soil profile, which is an important reference for horizontal and vertical correction of soil profile images. So, it will be detected with an improved YOLOv5 to raise its accuracy. Firstly, training samples will be expanded to solve the problem that soil profile images are less. Then to boost the detection accuracy and enhance generalization ability of the model, this paper adopts transfer learning and injects Channel Attention mechanism into YOLOv5 backbone network. Finally, the experimental sample set was used to conduct comparative experiments on soil profile ruler detection between the algorithm in this paper and other target detection algorithms to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm. The experimental results show that the improved YOLOv5s model exhibits an increase of 3.7% in precision, 1.6% in recall, 2.1% in mAP50, and 1.5% in mAP50-90 compared with the original YOLOv5s model. After YOLOv5s is trained with transfer learning, the improved YOLOv5s model exhibits an increase of 2.2% in precision, 2.9% in recall, 0.3% in mAP50, and 7.8% in mAP50-90. compared with YOLOv3 -tiny, YOLOv5m, YOLOv6 and YOLOv8s of the YOLO series, the algorithm in this paper demonstrates better accuracy, recall and mAP50. The above experimental results confirm that the algorithm proposed in this paper is effective and can accurately detect the soil profile ruler in the image.},

Despite the advantages of this trend, it is believed that AI-powered tools should be utilized to enhance the literature review process rather than completely automating it. For this reason, this paper examines the emerging concept of "Literature Review as a Service" (LRaaS) based on the human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI) perspective. Drawing on the theoretical background and service science, the paper explores a new approach to exploit the potential of AI-powered tools while putting people at the center of the research process.

Nowadays, soccer has been deeply integrated with artificial intelligence, and this paper combines artificial intelligence technology with deep learning, and for the difficult task of detecting players and soccer, firstly, we propose to use the deep learning-based image segmentation technology Mask R-CNN, and optimize the related computation by using residual network + feature pyramid network + RoI Align, and using binary cross-entropy loss function to predict the Pixel category not only highlights the boundaries of the image compared to traditional target detection methods, but also achieves pixel-level segmentation of each detection target, and achieves more accurate detection of players and soccer balls. Based on this, another algorithm optimized YOLOv3 is proposed for the lack of speed of Mask R-CNN, which employs a more efficient feature extraction network - -GhostNet and choosing a more appropriate a priori frame size and number and proposing the CIoU loss function for calculating the loss value of target localization to achieve a more efficient and lightweight detection of targets. Finally, for the simulated match, with the clubs, players, and soccer balls of both sides of the match as the detection targets, the data such as passes, shots, players' activity ranges, and other specific tasks are visualized and analyzed at the macro, meso, and micro levels.},

Traditional image recognition models have limitations in fine-grained defect feature extraction, which affects the accuracy and efficiency of recognition. In this paper, we propose an EfficientNet-B3 network optimization model based on the CBAM attention mechanism, which significantly improves the recognition of tiny defects in solar panels by combining deep learning techniques and attention mechanisms. Experimental results show that our model exhibits high accuracy on both training and validation sets with gradually decreasing loss. The model achieves an accuracy of 95.22% in complex and variable defect categories, which is significantly better than existing baseline models. An in-depth performance evaluation shows that the model has significant advantages in key performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 value, demonstrating its effectiveness and adaptability in the solar panel defect recognition task.},

This study proposes a method for detecting SQL injection attacks based on an improved Text-CNN model. The method starts with the preprocessing of collected SQL injection attack data, followed by the use of the convolutional layers of the Text-CNN model to extract local features, and then combines the CAM attention mechanism to achieve the task of SQL injection detection. The introduction of the CAM attention mechanism aims to merge the information from max pooling and average pooling to reduce information loss and enhance the global representation capability of the model. Experimental results show that the proposed method has improved in terms of accuracy, precision, recall rate, and F1 score, with values of 92.40%, 92.45%, 92.29%, and 0.9237, respectively. Given that traditional Text-CNN, Text-RNN, and CNN algorithms can perform well in recognizing SQL injection attacks, this provides help for subsequent applications in network security protection.},

At the same time, pre-trained models derived from extensive data training are extensively employed in various NLP tasks and have achieved excellent results.&nbsp;Based on this background, this study introduces a software defect detection system leveraging CodeBERT and Bi-LSTM.

However, this process is limited by the storage capacity of the large vocabulary grammar, which hampers the effectiveness and efficiency of error polishing. To overcome this constraint, deep learning algorithms are employed. These algorithms involve reconstructing the underlying hardware framework and optimizing the error polishing calculation parameters of the system software using deep learning algorithms. This allows for global replacement of deep learning algorithms, enhances the system's self-learning ability for error polishing, and frees it from the limitations of large vocabulary grammar information. The test results demonstrate that the continuous error polishing ability of this approach is superior. Among the error polishing systems tested, the designed system exhibits the best overall stress test performance, showcasing strong stability and control. The overall stability demonstrated by the stress test aligns with the standards and requirements of practical applications. As a result, the design system possesses good overall error polishing ability, system stability, and practical applicability.},

  abstract = {Current research on the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) on adolescent development yields mixed results, and parents are left to navigate this emerging technology without clear support and knowledge. A missing step toward effective digital parenting is understanding parents’ concerns and beliefs. Therefore, this preliminary study explores parental perspectives on the use and impact of GenAI on adolescents aged 13 to 17. We conducted a survey with N = 159 parents from 19 countries across Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Findings suggest that most parents are unaware of how their children use GenAI and feel disconnected from them on this topic. Importantly, while parents recognise the opportunities and risks of GenAI, their views vary based on their own familiarity with the technology, with those who use it regularly being significantly more optimistic about its impact on adolescents’ development. These results highlight a gap in digital parenting when it comes to adolescents’ use of GenAI, underscoring the need for a systematic approach to parental support. Future work will expand the survey into a larger-scale study and incorporate adolescents’ perspectives.},

  abstract = {In addressing the limited receptive field of single-layer convolution in EEG emotion recognition, the need to stack multiple layers of convolution for expanding the receptive field poses challenges of increased parameter size and training cost. Simultaneously, there is an oversight of channel information in EEG emotion recognition. To tackle these issues, this paper introduces a multi-feature EEG emotion recognition model based on 1D-Inception (1D-Inception-Channel-Spatial-LSTM Network, DCSL). DCSL integrates channel information, spatial features, and temporal dependencies, resulting in more effective EEG emotion recognition. The Inception structure is enhanced to fit EEG signals, enabling multi-scale convolution. The Channel Attention Module is introduced to learn the weights of different channels, enhancing emotion recognition performance. Additionally, a Spatial Attention mechanism is incorporated to further extract spatial features from EEG signals. To better capture the temporal dependencies in EEG signals, an LSTM module is introduced at the end of the model. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the DCSL network in EEG emotion recognition tasks.},

  abstract = {Addressing the performance and efficiency challenges of detecting small target defects on PCB (printed circuit board), this research proposes a lightweight inspection model for YOLOv8-based. The initial step involves employing an enhanced Efficient_Detect network architecture with the aim of diminishing the volume of model parameters and computational intricacy, while simultaneously augmenting resource utilization. Then, the deformable convolutional networks v2 (DCNv2) are integrated into the C2f structure to improve feature extraction for defects with diverse shapes on the PCB surface, enhancing the model's capability to identify different categories of flaws. Meanwhile, the Inner-SIoU loss function is utilized instead of the conventional CIoU loss function to enhance both the precision of inspection and the robustness of the model. The enhanced approach achieves an mAP50 of 96.8% and an mAP50-95 of 72.2%, marking an improvement of 3.9% and 10.1%, respectively, comparison with base YOLOv8n model. In addition, the parameter counts of the model, GFLOPs, and weight size are notably reduced by 18.4%, 33.3%, and 19.7%, respectively, resulting in final metrics of 2.34 M, 5.4 GFLOPs, and a weight size of 4.9 M. In addition, the detection speed can reach up to 161 FPS, which has the potential for real-time detection. It provides an efficient and lightweight PCB small target defect detection solution for scenarios with limited computing resources.},

  abstract = {Although various methods have been proposed to improve the robustness of deep neural network models, evaluating these models in a fair and reasonable manner remains a challenge. Existing evaluation methods often consider only limited types of attacks, ignoring the generalization performance against new types of attacks, and fail to cover the most advanced defense models. To address these issues, we propose a unified framework to evaluate model robustness under different types of attacks. This framework integrates non-Lp and Lp attacks, and comprehensively evaluates the robustness of various advanced robust models on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet subsets. Experimental results show that even the most advanced defense models exhibit vulnerabilities under certain new types of attacks, highlighting the importance of developing more comprehensive robustness benchmarks and providing guidance for the design of future robust deep learning models.},

The use of AI facilitates the development of a picture library that is thoughtfully crafted to match the distinctive linguistic and thematic characteristics inherent in classical poetry. This machine-generated system creates atmospheric drawings with respect to the text of the poem, giving designers a series of idea visualisations. The drawings are utilized as a basis for the subsequent design of VR scenes, in which sensory experiences and avatars are employed to immerse the user in the poetic environment. The system takes full advantage of user interactivity and imagination, providing an active platform for exploring poetic moods.

In this paper, the influence of the structure size, circuit connection mode and fixing mode of the 0kHz-35kHz receiving transducer on the performance of the receiving transducer is numerically simulated. It is concluded that shorter and thicker piezoelectric patches can effectively improve the receiving sensitivity, bandwidth and stability of the receiving transducer. The series circuit connection mode has good reception sensitivity stationarity, and the reception sensitivity stationarity is improved by 23.8dB, but its reception sensitivity stationarity is extremely poor. The fixed boundary condition at both ends can obviously broaden the receiving bandwidth of impulse sound source receiver and transducer, but the receiving sensitivity of fixed boundary condition at both ends is smaller than that of free boundary condition and free boundary condition at one end. This conclusion has theoretical reference significance for the manufacture of impulse sound source receiving transducer.},

  abstract = {Through the mechanism of propagating and aggregating information, graph neural networks have achieved impressive results in link prediction tasks. However, the higher-order patterns (higher-order links) prediction task is still challenging. The conventional idea directly expands existing methods used in pairwise relationship prediction. Information propagation is limited to local neighborhoods and the evaluation basis uses only the similarity between pairs of nodes. These methods fail to consider the underlying driving factors of higher-order formation processes. Therefore, a key strategy is introducing a driving factor that helps information propagation beyond the local scope and provides a global comparable criterion between multiple nodes. Cluster structure is one crucial driving factor observed in networks, where nodes within the same cluster exhibit similar behaviors and tend to form higher-order patterns. To this end, we use Clustering Information as a Driving factor for graph structure adjustments in Graph Convolutional Network (CIDGCN). CIDGCN uses clustering information to facilitate the prediction of higher-order patterns. It also extends the propagation of node information to the cluster level for Graph Convolutional Network to perform message-passing. Finally, we obtain more reliable features for higher-order patterns. CIDGCN is experimentally compared to four higher-order benchmarks, revealing its superiority in accurately predicting higher-order patterns.},

  abstract = {We propose an algorithm for road crack detection, leveraging enhancements to YOLOv7. This approach aims to overcome challenges related to the limited capacity for extracting features from irregularly shaped road crack targets and the sluggish inference speed caused by the intricate model structure. In this algorithm, YOLOv7 is used as the foundation. Firstly, the Detect module is improved to a Decoupled Head Detect module to augment the detection capacity of the model on feature maps. Then, the Head part is augmented with an ELAN-G module based on GSConv to reduce the model's parameter computation and accelerate the inference speed. Finally, Deformable Conv is employed to modify the original ELAN module into an ELAN-D module and integrate it into the Backbone part to bolster the model's capability in extracting irregular-shaped crack targets. Experimental results on the CRDDC-2020-US dataset demonstrate that the improved algorithm achieves a 10% enhancement in detection accuracy, with the mAP(0.5) increasing from 53.7% to 59.4%. Furthermore, the model's parameter computation is decreased by 12%, while the throughput in terms of the number of images processed per second during inference is boosted by 13%. This algorithm proves to be effective for road crack detection applications.},

In many network texts, sentiment analysis of each entity has always been an important issue. The traditional Bi-LSTM model has the problem of gradient explosion or excessive correction in the learning rate, which affects the convergence speed and stability of the model. In this paper, a Bi-LSTM optimization model combining progressive preheating and cosine annealing is proposed, which uses word embedding technology, word shape reduction technology and named entity recognition technology. Experiments show that our model can achieve high accuracy on both the training set and the verification set, and the loss is gradually reduced. It shows an accuracy of up to 84.13 % in both positive and negative categories, which is significantly better than the existing baseline model. Through in-depth comparative analysis, the model shows obvious advantages in key performance indicators such as accuracy, recall rate and F1 value.},

  abstract = {Most recent algorithms of RGB-T salient object detection have two issues remain unresolved. The first one is that existing methods don't fully explore and exploit the potentials of complementary of different modalities and multi-type cues of images, which play a vital role in achieving accurate results. And the second is that it is difficult to determine which of the two modalities contributes more in the feature fusion stage.To address these problems, we propose a dual-decoder importance-aware gated network called LNet. Specifically, we set the dual-decoder architecture to solve the cross-modality interaction problem. It can dig out the characteristics of two modalities, and fuse the cross-modality complementarity information more effectively. In particular, the importance-aware gated part Screening Mechanism (SM) can suppress saliency bias and let model avoid obtaining the results dominated by one modality.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LNet achieves better performance than the 11 state-of-the-art on three public datasets.},

However, the recording conditions of EMA-synchronized speech and stand-alone speech are different, which may make the EMA-synchronized speech different to the stand-alone speech and degrade the performance of downstream tasks. Hence, it is necessary to shed light on whether the EMA-synchronized speech and stand-alone speech signals are different, and if so, how this affects the performance of the models trained with synchronized acoustic-articulatory data. In this study, we explore differences between EMA-synchronized speech and stand-alone speech from the aspect of speech recognition, and its influence on the performance of AAI. The results indicate the performance of phone error rate increases from 7.8% for stand-alone speech to 37.4% for EMA-synchronized speech, and the RMSE increases from 0.71mm for EMA- synchronized speech to 3.07mm when the input is switched from EMA-synchronized speech to stand-alone speech for the AAI model trained with EMA-synchronized speech.},

Integrating with AIGC, vehicular networks are evolving as the next-generation intelligent transportation system, i.e., vehicular Metaverses, which can significantly enrich the diverse and personalized immersive experience of vehicular applications for drivers and passengers. Nevertheless, due to the high demand for AIGC services and the limited coverage of RoadSide Units (RSUs), it is still challenging to efficiently allocate RSU resources for massive vehicular users. In this paper, we propose an attribute-aware auction-based mechanism for real-time resource allocation in vehicular AIGC services, which considers both price and non-monetary attributes. In this mechanism, we first formulate the resource-attribute matching problem as a weighted bipartite graph to determine potential market participants. Then, we train an auctioneer in a double Dutch auction using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms to adjust the auction clocks efficiently during the clock adjustment process. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed DRL-based auction scheme outperforms existing baseline schemes in terms of average cumulative reward, convergence speed, social welfare, and auction information exchange costs.},

  abstract = {Following the rise of generative artificial intelligence technology, the educational industry has gradually become more innovative. But opportunities always coexist with challenges. The way to collaborate Human-AI relation in education needs to be concentrated on. This paper explores the practical application and effects of GenAI in tiered teaching implementation and student English capability development for higher vocational students upgrading to undergraduate colleges by using a mixed-methods approach. The study observed measurable improvements in students' language proficiency, application ability, and critical thinking skills. Specifically, instant feedback from AI allowed them to refine the grammar, translation, writing and other language skills when they finish personalized learning and human-AI collaborative tasks. However, the survey also reveals technology dependency and insufficient evaluation criteria for AI-enabled tasks. To solve these problems, the author suggested to implement “human-AI collaboration” mode to concentrate on proper evaluation criteria, ethical education, and dynamic monitoring mechanisms. By doing so, it will be worthy data in English education and verify the unique value of GenAI in balancing college education with personalized cultivation.},

  abstract = {Pedestrian detection is commonly studied using visible light (RGB) images. However, in environments with poor lighting or occlusions, the performance of object detection using RGB images tends to be subpar. In contrast, infrared (IR) images yield better results in such special circumstances. Therefore, multispectral image fusion for pedestrian detection is increasingly being adopted. While this feature interaction and fusion approach enhances features, it can also introduce background noise, preventing the model from focusing on pedestrians. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight network with Unet and attention mechanism (UANet). UANet enhances the accuracy of pedestrian detection under varying illuminance by combining the strengths of RGB-IR image pairs. In UANet, a UNet-based module is designed for extracting and reusing multi-scale features from RGB images. To further extract high-level features, we incorporate a fully connected module into the UNet-based module. For infrared images, we employ high-frequency attention and average attention to extract target features from infrared images and fuse them with RGB features. In experiments, we validate the effectiveness of UANet in improving pedestrian detection performance. We conducted tests on the KAIST dataset, yielding a result of 95.23% mAP and 7.65% MR.},

This paper proposes a comprehensive technology of defect classification method for pressure gas cylinders based on on-site collection of gas cylinder defect data set. The main work is as follows: 1) Aiming at the problem of insufficient number and unbalanced distribution of field-collected defect samples, a DA-DCGAN based on the dual-channel attention mechanism is designed to increase the sample data, and a self-attention generator and a dual-channel discriminator are constructed to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the generated samples; 2) Based on the augmented and broadened dataset, a design of a cascaded HRNet classification network is proposed to increase the quality of pressure gas cylinders by means of global feature extraction, and local feature extraction for feature fusion to achieve multiple classification of defects based on infrared gas cylinder images. Compared with the mainstream classification methods DenseNet, ResNet, and VGG, the cascaded HRNet method improves the average AUC by 6.1% and achieves the highest scores in two defect types. For temperature fluctuation experiments under real working conditions, good performance is achieved, proving the effectiveness and anti-interference of the improved model.},

  abstract = {Crowd counting in dense scenes is a crucial task in the field of computer vision that aims to estimate crowd statistics by predicting the location of heads. However, the accuracy of detection algorithms usually depends on manual precision labeling of a vast amount of data, which is less feasible in practical scene applications due to its high labeling cost. Moreover, the manual labeling process is prone to errors such as false labeling and missing labeling due to overlapping and small targets in the image. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a pseudo label generation algorithm based on semi-supervised learning for dense crowd datasets. The proposed algorithm employs the self-training method of target detection in semi-supervised learning to generate pseudo-labels offline. Furthermore, the algorithm uses existing point labels in dense crowd datasets to correct the positioning information, which significantly reduces the high labeling cost. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on three widely used benchmarks, ShanghaiTech, NWPU-Crowd, and UCF-QNRF, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.},

In such an environment, system logs, as key data that record the operating status of computer systems, user operations and various events, play an extremely important role in monitoring system health and quickly locating and resolving system failures. However, the current accuracy of log parsing is not high enough to meet the actual demand; the parsing process is inefficient and difficult to adapt to the processing requirements of large data log files. Aiming at the problems of insufficient accuracy of log parsing and low efficiency of parsing process, a log parsing method AT-parser (Log parser based on word attributes and parse trees) is proposed. Through the log preprocessing, the log content used in the subsequent construction of log templates can be separated, the log content combined with word attribute filtering, retaining the key words, constructing a string set through the key words, and then performing similarity clustering based on the string set to classify the log strings into different log groups. Finally, the final template sequence is generated by constructing a parse tree, which improves the accuracy and speeds up the parsing efficiency. Finally, the effectiveness of AT-Parser is verified by experiments on public datasets.},

  abstract = {The accurate decoding and intention recognition of motor imagery electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) are of great significance for the implementation of brain computer interface (BCI). However, the time non-stationary properties of MI-EEG signals and the uneven information distribution of different electrode channels pose challenges to the classification of MI-EEG. To address these challenges, we proposed a convolutional network based on channel and temporal attention (CTACNet). First, raw MI-EEG signals underwent noise reduction by common average reference. Subsequently, channel attention module was used to enhance the electrode channel information related to classification. Then, shallow spatiotemporal features of MI-EEG were extracted through convolutional neural network, and time series representations containing spatial information were output. Importantly, time attention module automatically adjusted and learned the impact of different time series on classification. Finally, deep spatiotemporal features were further extracted through time convolutional network, and fully connected layers were used to complete the classification of MI-EEG. Validation experiments based on the BCI competition IV-2a dataset showed that the proposed CTACNet achieved an average classification accuracy of 84.22% for each subject. Compared with MBEEGSE, ETCNet, EEG-TCNet, and CNN-LSTM, there were significant improvements of 2.20%, 9.42%, 4.50%, and 5.40%, respectively. This demonstrates the potential of CTACNet in significantly enhancing MI-EEG decoding and intent recognition.},

  abstract = {The goal of Few Shot Object Detection (FSOD) task is to effectively train and deploy object detection models even in small datasets, in order to achieve high-precision object detection results. Due to the few shot size of the dataset, the model may have difficulty learning sufficiently generalized feature representations, which can lead to overfitting or underfitting issues. Specifically, the model performs well during training, but shows a significant poor performance on test. That's because model overfits the noise and specific samples of the data in the training set, resulting in the inability to generalize to new data. Secondly, in the case of few shots, the target category scale in the dataset is single, making it difficult for the model to distinguish the same target at different scales, which affects detection accuracy. In order to effectively perform FSOD tasks, this paper proposes a meta learning FSOD algorithm based on PRN-FPN. Firstly, a data augmentation module is proposed to address the issue of data scarcity in few shot situations. The module includes three conversion strategies: color, color, and histogram equalization. Combining these three strategies can effectively increase the diversity of scarce data. In order to improve the algorithm's recognition and detection of targets of the same category but different scales, a Predictor head Removing Network with Feature Pyramid Network (PRN FPN) module is proposed. The module adds CARAFE Feature Pyramid Network on the basis of Predictor head Removal Network (RPN), and has the ability to detect few shot objects at multiple scales by fusing features at different depths. Finally, the algorithm was trained and tested on the publicly available dataset Pascal VOC, and the experimental results showed its effectiveness.},

The model demonstrates that the effect of redemptions on asset prices is linear, and the subsequent impact on fund performance is contingent on the initial shock level and asset liquidity diversity. Our findings suggest that funds those holding illiquid stocks face higher liquidity risks, and the liquidity level of underlying common assets between mutual fund portfolios dictates the extent of losses in the liquidated stock prices and the connected fund NAVs. Second, higher liquidity levels of common assets result in lower level of portfolio overlap. These findings highlight the urgency of establishing unified liquidity standard measurements and a cash buffer criterion. To manage fund stability and liquidity effectively, it is essential to implement measures such as minimum cash requirements and optimized asset allocation.

  abstract = {In recent years, with the development of the Internet, APT malware detection remains an important issue for society. The lengthy nature of API sequence text leads to polysemy issues with distant repeated words. Traditional deep learning models must improve extracting the long-term dependencies of entire API sequences. During an APT attack, attackers combine benign and malicious sequences to conceal their malicious intent, resulting in localized malignancy. In response to these issues, the paper proposes A BERT-Transformer-TextCNN model for attack detection. BERT encodes API sequences, addressing the polysemy issue of distant repeated words. The Transformer-encoder extracts long-term dependencies, resolving the global feature issues of long sequences, and TextCNN is applied to capture local sequence information to solve the problem of localized malignancy. Based on actual APT malware samples, BERT encoding achieves higher precision than traditional encoders. Employing a Transformer-Encoder to extract long-term dependencies yields higher precision than using BiLSTM to extract long-term relationships. When adding features related to local feature correlation, the precision increased by 3.39%.},

  abstract = {The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has led the AI community to speculate that artificial superintelligence (ASI) may be within reach, particularly if an AI system can iteratively search for solutions, learn from results, and leverage improved knowledge for more searches. In this context, this study explores the integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into Building Information Modeling (BIM) by focusing on the four key pillars of the OpenAI o1 model and their ethical implications. Through comprehensive analysis of existing literature, we examine these pillars—policy initialization, reward design, search strategies, and learning mechanisms—and their application in BIM-GenAI within a continuous improvement cycle. Results demonstrate that policy initialization generates human-like reasoning behaviors and domain-specific knowledge for BIM tasks. Reward design, central to reinforcement learning, optimizes BIM objectives through measurable metrics and learned evaluation methods. Search strategies prove valuable for exploring complex design spaces and generating high-quality BIM solutions, while learning mechanisms, including policy gradient and behavior cloning, enable continuous model improvement through feedback. The study emphasizes the importance of establishing BIM-AI protocols, maintaining human expertise in decision-making, and balancing automation with human input. Our findings suggest that while GenAI, powered by reinforcement learning, offers significant potential for enhancing BIM capabilities, three critical ethical considerations—data privacy and security, algorithmic bias mitigation, and transparency and accountability—must guide responsible implementation. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on AI in construction technologies and provides a foundation for the ethical advancement of BIM-GenAI systems using OpenAI o1.},

  abstract = {Offline reinforcement learning aims to empower agents to derive effective strategies from a pre-existing dataset for decision-making tasks. This learning paradigm has a broad application prospect in areas with high safety constraints, such as healthcare and robotic control. However, existing offline reinforcement learning algorithms often overlook the impact of the dataset's inherent multimodal distribution on policy optimization during the training phase, leading to compromised model performance. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel offline reinforcement learning algorithm based on mixture density policy network, MDPo ( Mixture Density Policy). The MDPo algorithm initially employs an expected regression loss function to train the value function. Subsequently, it constructs the policy using a mixture density network and trains the policy through a distributional constraint, ultimately learning a high-quality policy model under the combined influence of the reward signal and policy constraints. Predominantly leveraging mixture density networks, MDPo models the policy as a multimodal distribution, enhancing the policy's representational capacity to better fit the multimodal distribution of actions in the dataset, thereby increasing training process stability and improving model performance. Experiments conducted on the Antmaze task of the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that MDPo significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, also demonstrating the enhancement of training stability.},

  abstract = {In order to solve the problem of low segmentation accuracy due to the interference of noise information such as light and shadow in the current lightweight blind segmentation model, we propose a fast tactile paving segmentation model based on reparameterize. The multi-branch training structure learns spatial features such as tactile paving, light and shadow while compensating for the loss of information in the feature map due to downsampling operations as well as enhancing the learning of its features in the channel dimension. The single-branch structure obtained after reparameterization of the multibranch structure ensures faster inference of the model as well as lower memory access costs. The introduction of coordinate attention allows the model to learn the distribution law of the features of tactile paving, light and shadow, etc. in the spatial dimension and automatically generate the attention map with weight information, effectively reducing the weight of the spatial structural features of noise such as light and shadow. Experiments show that the model's ability to resist interference from environmental noise such as light and shadow has been enhanced and the segmentation accuracy has been further improved under the premise of ensuring the inference speed.},

The strategy integrates adapter technology by incorporating a small-parameter adapter module on the main model, introducing highly adaptive external components tailored to each language pair to alleviate multilingual interference without altering the main model structure. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in multilingual translation tasks involving Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, and Chinese. Compared to traditional multilingual baseline models, this method achieves a significant improvement with an average BLEU score increase of up to 1.34 in many-to-one translation scenarios and 0.7 in one-to-many translation scenarios.

However, current music recommendation methods are mainly recommended through collaborative filtering, content-based, and manual rule methods, and cannot be recommended based on the user's real-time status, resulting in the recommended music does not meet the real-time needs of users. In response to this situation, this paper proposes a personalized music recommendation model based on human physiological signals. This model first analyzes the user's physiological data, such as heart rate, electrodermal activity, etc., and uses a graph convolutional neural network algorithm to perceive the user's real-time emotional state. It then achieves more accuracy and personalization music recommendations based on the relationship model between emotion and music selection. This research not only expands the research scope in the field of music recommendation, but also provides new ideas and methods for the further development of intelligent music recommendation systems.},

  abstract = {In response to the issues of existing face liveness detection models, such as performance degradation under complex lighting conditions and poor generalization performance across datasets, we propose a 3D Mask Detection Algorithm by introducing attention mechanism and feature fusion methods. This approach is designed based on FlowNet2 and MobileNetV3. Firstly, the improved optical flow model is used to obtain optical flow feature maps, which are then convolved to calculate frames with larger motion trajectories. Weighted allocation is performed for spatial features of multiple frames, followed by spatial feature aggregation. Secondly, the improved MobileNetV3 is employed to process spatio-temporal features and obtain deep features. A feature fusion method based on attention mechanism is used to fuse spatio-temporal features. Finally, the fused features are inputted into a classifier to obtain prediction scores. Compared with classical face liveness detection methods, our model exhibits better detection performance and generalization ability. In experiments on the HiFiMask dataset, the minimum detection error rate is only 2.07%, outperforming classical detection methods such as CDCN++ and LeTSrPPG. Our face liveness detection method captures the abnormal traces of 3D masks spliced with faces through the optical flow features obtained by the optical flow model and the fusion of spatio-temporal information. This method is insensitive to lighting conditions and performs excellently in cross-dataset experiments, demonstrating a certain level of generalization performance.},

Specifically, we introduce a Natural Language Guiding Module (NLGM) to generate remote sensing image captions with rich spatial information, and then use CLIP Text Encoder to generate Guiding Text Embeddings. We use a Multimodal Fusion Attention Module (MFAM) to combine textual information with the visual features of remote sensing images to adapt to building extraction specific tasks.

However, it also brings about an escalating risk of personal information leakage. In this context, the methods and standards for determining the acts of infringement have yet to be clarified, leading to different judgements in the same case. Grounded on the existing modes of legislation and judicial adjudication, the paper proposes machine learning methods to deconstruct the determination of acts of infringement, with a goal of assisting judges in making more accurate judgments. Specifically, the paper employs Adaboost regression model and the logistic regression model with gradient descent. Adaboost regression model combines multiple weak classifiers to improve the accuracy of classification, while the logistic regression model with gradient descent adjusts model values by minimizing the loss function to pursue the optimal ones. Through training and evaluation, the paper reveals that these models possess favorable applicability in determining the acts of infringement. Moreover, the paper also mentions the predictive results and evaluation metrics of the models, as well as their validation and application under various determination methods.Through the application of mathematical models and machine learning algorithms, the paper deconstructs the methods of infringement determination in personal information protection disputes. The evaluation and analysis of the models' applicability provides a guarantee for its adaption to different methods of determination, ensuring a reliable algorithmic model for the judicial review of personal information protection disputes when applying machine learning.},

The initial multi-scale structure based on LIBP was innovatively used to extract the shallow feature information of the network. Features were extracted from high-dimensional data using the inverted residual structure, and redundant feature maps were generated in a cheaper way by Ghost convolution. Random depth structure and flooding regularization were used to prevent overfitting of the model. To evaluate the validity of the proposed model, a series of comparative experiments were conducted. Compared with the standard residual network, the accuracy of the model proposed in this paper was improved by 5.90% and 9.72% respectively under -4dB and -10dB noise.

  abstract = {Graph classification has significant applications in various domains, including chemical molecular structure prediction, social network analysis, recommendation systems, and biological network analysis, and has received considerable attention in recent years. However, real-world graph datasets often exhibit class imbalance, where the disproportionate distribution of classes can cause models to favor the majority class, reducing prediction accuracy for minority classes. Notably, minority or anomalous classes often hold unique value in many practical scenarios. This paper proposes a framework for graph classification under category imbalance named Generator Imbalanced Graph Classification(GIGC). GIGC employs a set of learnable augmented graph generators orchestrated by an automated augmentation strategy to enhance minority-class graphs. This approach increases the diversity of minority-class samples, balances the dataset's class distribution, and improves the model's generalization capabilities. Simultaneously, k-reciprocal nearest neighbors are utilized to capture inter-graph relationships more effectively, leveraging the properties of symmetry and reciprocity. Subsequently, Graph-of-Graph Neural Networks are used to model inter-graph relationships, capturing global associations between graphs at a higher level. This enables the model to better capture and utilize inter-graph information. By leveraging the latent connections between minority-class graphs and other graphs, GIGC enriches the representation of minority-class graphs, mitigating the negative effects of class imbalance on classification performance. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that GIGC outperforms baseline methods in graph classification. Specifically, F1-macro and F1-micro are improved by at least 1.12% and 2.62%, respectively. These results validate the effectiveness of GIGC in addressing class imbalance in graph classification tasks.},

  abstract = {AI-pair programming is a novel approach to software development that involves a human developer and an AI assistant working together on the same code. AI-pair programming aims to improve the productivity, quality, and creativity of software development by leveraging the complementary strengths of human and AI agents. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence on its impact on code quality and developer satisfaction. In this paper, we conduct a case study of TiMi studio, a leading mobile game development studio group that has been using AI-pair programming tools since 2023, and has produced several popular and high-quality games. We collect and analyze data from code repositories, code reviews, developer surveys, and developer interviews, to measure and compare the code quality and developer satisfaction of AI-pair and non-AI-pair projects. The results show that AI-pair programming has a positive impact on code quality and developer satisfaction, as it offers various benefits, such as time-saving, error-avoiding, skill-learning, possibility-exploring, feedback-receiving, and quality-improving. The results also reveal some challenges, such as reliability-questioning, explainability-questioning, trust-lacking, communication-lacking, autonomy-losing, and motivation-losing, which need to be addressed and overcome by improving and enhancing the AI-pair programming tools and practices. The paper provides empirical and practical evidence on the impact of AI-pair programming on code quality and developer satisfaction, and provides useful and actionable insights and guidance for developers, managers, researchers, and educators, who are interested in or involved in AI-pair programming, and who want to improve and optimize their software development process and outcomes.},

  abstract = {In the digital era, the rapid development of e-commerce logistics networks is crucial for maintaining operational efficiency, especially under emergency conditions such as epidemics and earthquakes. This study introduces a novel framework for optimizing e-commerce logistics by integrating AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) with Back Propagation (BP) neural networks, further refined through Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization. Utilizing cargo volume data over a two-year period, we developed a sophisticated ARIMA-BP model to forecast the daily cargo volume for each route for the subsequent month. The subsequent application of a GA-optimized BP neural network aims to achieve a multi-objective optimization, focusing on minimizing the impact of route disruptions and balancing workload distribution across the network. We employed network centrality measures—degree, closeness, and betweenness—to evaluate the significance of logistics sites and routes, enhancing the network's resilience and operational efficiency. This approach also facilitated the integration of new logistics sites and routes, bolstering network performance. Further, we introduced a stochastic perturbation technique to explore the network's adaptability to both anticipated and unforeseen flow changes post-route closure. Finally, complex network topology analysis was applied to assess the robustness of the logistics network. Our methodology exemplifies a comprehensive strategy for e-commerce logistics optimization, offering a robust framework for enhancing network resilience and efficiency in face of emergencies, thereby contributing to the reduction of operational costs and improvement of service quality.},

  abstract = {The Air Quality Index (AQI) is an effective measure of air quality, and accurate prediction of the AQI is important for air pollution control and the daily travel of people. Air pollutants have strong spatio-temporal correlation, and the current air quality prediction methods often fail to adequately extract the spatio-temporal features in the data, which can cause prediction accuracy problems. This paper proposed a Self-Tuning Spatio-Temporal Residual Network (AAM-AST2RN) fusing adaptive adjacency matrix and attention mechanism for enhanced air quality prediction. AAM-AST2RN utilized a parallel network structure, which was capable of fully extracting and fusing spatio-temporal features and automatically adjusting the network hyperparameters. In addition, the AAM-AST2RN model constructed the AAM generation module, residual connection and Improved Channel Attention mechanism (ICA), the AAM generation module avoided the adverse effect of static adjacency matrix on the model feature extraction, the residual connection and ICA effectively alleviated the node feature over-smoothing problem caused by Graph Convolutional neural Network (GCN) in the model and improved the node feature differentiation. In order to validate the model effect, the model was utilized to predict the AQI of 12 air monitoring sites in Beijing, and compared with the prediction effect of Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory neural network (ConvLSTM), combined Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory neural network (CNN-LSTM), and GCN-LSTM. Compared with the above three spatio-temporal prediction models, the coefficient of determination (R2) of the AAM-AST2RN model was improved by 11.30%, 1.95%, and 1.54%, respectively, and the prediction error was lower. The AAM-AST2RN air quality prediction model proposed in this paper can fully extract the spatio-temporal features in the data and has a good prediction performance for air quality.},

Furthermore, the densely connected convolutional network makes the enhanced features clearer and transmission of gradients more effective through dense connections, which would improve the training effect of the model. The tested results on four public data sets of the AES algorithm show that, compared with the existing deep learning side-channel attack models, the attention mechanism can effectively improve the feature extraction ability of the proposed model, so that the model have more adaptable to different datasets, then the number of traces needed to complete key recovery is reduced.},

  abstract = {In recent years, there has been significant progress in the quality of neural machine translation technology, largely attributed to the abundance of high-quality bilingual parallel sentences. However, low-resource languages face a challenge as the availability of bilingual parallel corpora is limited, leading to subpar translation performance. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces a data augmentation approach based on semantic word replacement specifically designed for neural machine translation of low-resource languages. The method comprises two key steps: firstly, expanding the corpus of low-resource languages through semantic word replacement techniques; secondly, utilizing a neural grammar correction model to proofread the augmented bilingual parallel corpora. Subsequently, these corrected corpora are merged with the original corpus to mitigate the data scarcity for low-resource languages. Experimental evaluations were conducted on various low-resource language pairs (including Mongolian-Chinese, Tibetan-Chinese, Uyghur-Chinese, Arabic-Chinese) as well as English-German and German-English translation tasks. The results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly enhances the translation quality of low-resource languages, achieving a maximum BLEU score improvement of up to 3.06 compared to the baseline system, underscoring the efficacy of the approach.},

Currently, there is a lack of published research on automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology for the Putian dialect due to various reasons. One notable example is the absence of an audio corpus specifically for this dialect. Moreover, the pronunciation of Putian dialect significantly differs from that of Mandarin used in our daily lives. This paper aims to address these challenges by collecting 8000 isolated words from a phonetic corpus dedicated to the Putian dialect. Based on this self-built database, I attempt to achieve speech recognition for the Putian dialect using various models such as single phoneme model recognition, three-phoneme model, linear discriminant analysis, maximum likelihood change, speaker adaptive training, quick model and DNN-HMM model. Notably, the DNN-HMM-2 model yields the best results with a word error rate of 20.56%. In this experiment, I introduce an additional layer of mapping in order to construct a two-step mapping method for phoneme - Putian dialect - Mandarin alignment. This approach improves training alignment accuracy and reduces character error rate by approximately 3% compared to using only one-level mapping.},

Instances of students submitting AI-generated assignments prompt investigations into implications for teaching, learning, and academic integrity. Recent publications highlight concerns such as a lack of conceptual understanding, threats to academic integrity, and disruptions to traditional assessment methods. While recognizing benefits like automated scoring and personalized learning, authors stress the responsible use of GenAI, emphasizing the educator's role in guiding students. This commentary identifies opportunities and threats of GenAI in African university contexts. Opportunities include increased operational efficiency, content generation, automated assessment, recognition of accessibility needs, overcoming language barriers, and accelerated research. However, these tools require human correction and cautious consideration of job displacement concerns. Threats encompass job displacement, privacy and security issues, threats to academic integrity, hallucinations/confabulations of GenAI, access and infrastructure challenges, technological overemphasis, lack of customization for local needs and cultural contexts, dependency on external providers, and unaffordable costs. The need for robust guidelines that balance technological advances with traditional teaching methods in African universities is emphasized. Given digital transformation initiatives like the African Union's Agenda 2063 and Botswana's SmartBots strategy, integrating GenAI could shape the future of African tertiary education. Proactive policies should address ethical concerns, ensure access, and make GenAI tools available, requiring a collaborative effort to navigate its impact responsibly.},

  abstract = {Transformer have been widely used in the field of natural language processing due to their excellent performance, but the high computational cost and large parameter scale limit the efficiency of actual deployment. As an effective model compression technique, model distillation constructs small-scale student models from large models through knowledge transfer, significantly reducing resource requirements. However, there is a risk of information leakage during the distillation process of the model. This article deeply analyzes the potential mechanisms of information leakage in the distillation process of Transformer, including data reproduction attacks, reverse inference attacks, and other issues. In response to the above risks, a method combining differential privacy technology with secure multi-party computation was proposed for protection, and its effectiveness was verified through experiments. Research has shown that this method can significantly reduce the risk of information leakage while ensuring model performance.},

  abstract = {In practical application environments, the task of piano music transcription confronts a series of challenges including the long-tail distribution characteristics of training data, inadequate transcription accuracy in multi-key scenarios, interference from environmental noise, and the inability of mobile devices to meet the demands of real-time transcription. This study builds upon the Onsets and Frames model and introduces a series of structural improvements aimed at enhancing model performance. These include the simplification and optimization of the model structure, the introduction of data augmentation strategies, and the refinement of the loss function. Precise quantization of the model, coupled with effective mobile deployment strategies, ensures the efficient operation of the model on mobile devices. Experimental validation in the mobile environment demonstrates that the proposed improvements significantly enhance transcription accuracy in various scenarios, achieving a 56.98% increase in transcription speed compared to the original model, thereby meeting the requirements for real-time transcription. Moreover, the new model exhibits substantial noise resistance capabilities, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio conditions where the performance degradation is considerably less than that of the original model.},

  abstract = {This application paper introduces a transformative solution to address the labour-intensive manual report generation, data searching and report revision process in government entities. Traditional methods of data extraction, analysis, and graph creation for annual reports are not only time-consuming but also prone to human errors. To mitigate these challenges, we propose an innovative system leveraging Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), with a specific focus on large language models (LLMs). Our solution incorporates automated data extraction from diverse sources designated as internal knowledge base, text analysis, summarization using advanced language models, and the generation as well as revisions of informative graphs. Different LLMs like Google's Gemini Pro and OpenAI's GPT 4.0 have been used to read different data visualisation graphs and fetch the information from the internal knowledge base, respectively, to update the graphs in an automated manner. Solution implementation using Python language on the World Economic Situation and Prospects report by the Department of Economic &amp; Social Affairs, United Nation shows that the early result produces almost 0.87% to 17.46% average error rates in the task of factual data visualisation graph. Key benefits of this approach include improved time efficiency, consistency in report format, enhanced insights, and a user-friendly interface.

A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on probability model is designed for the model. Taking a hazardous material transportation network with 5 transportation vehicles, 24 demand nodes, and 6 densely populated areas as an example, validate the model and algorithm.

Carrier-based aircraft emergencies have complexity, tight coupling and strong real-time characteristics. Therefore, it is of great significance to reasonably predict the development trend of the incident in the emergency treatment to reduce the harm. Due to the sudden and random nature of naval battlefield accidents, some incidents are not covered by the historical case base. Traditional retrieval approaches to event prediction using case knowledge are limited by the sparsity of events and the cold-start problem. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-graph neural network for event development trend prediction, which disassembles events into event features and introduces the shipboard aircraft domain knowledge graph. We produce a data set around the event features of carrier-based aircraft on the simulation platform. The results show that the graph neural network with knowledge graph is superior in modeling the higher-order semantic association between event features.

By incorporating the Longformer-based self-attention mechanism, DyLF can flexibly adjust the range of visible time domain while encoding temporal features of nodes in dynamic graphs and efficiently capture temporal dependencies between snapshots, thereby enhancing the ability to extract more effective temporal information.

Unfortunately, traditional models have their limitations when dealing with complex relational data related mainly to the relationship between students and problems, while the characteristics as well as potential relationships among students are almost left neglected. In response, this paper proposes a Neural Network Student Cognitive Diagnosis Model Based on Multi-Relational Graph (MGNCD) that brings together the powers of Graph Attention Network (GAT) and Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN) to model multi-dimensional heterogeneous nodes such as students, classes, problems, and skills. The introduction of various edge types and random edge connection strategies allowed the model to tackle data sparsity and heterogeneity. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model outperforms traditional methods in accuracy (ACC) and area under the curve (AUC), which provides an encouraging novel insight into cognitive diagnosis.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an Android certificate validation vulnerability detection framework that integrates static analysis, adversarial sample training, and optimization via large language models. Centered around the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network, the framework aims to enhance the robustness and generalization ability of static detection models against complex and obfuscated attack patterns. Static analysis is performed on 2,000 popular Android applications from the androzoo dataset, with code and configuration features extracted, focusing on certificate-related API usage, permission declarations, and network security settings. Among them, 110 APKs are identified as containing high-risk certificate misconfigurations. Based on these features, a Transformer-based model is constructed for feature vectorization and vulnerability identification. To further improve model robustness, WGAN is employed to generate adversarial samples that mimic real-world evasive vulnerabilities, which are used for adversarial training. Additionally, large language models are used to perform In-Context Learning, enabling semantic filtering, sample refinement, and iterative generator feedback. This results in a closed-loop, self-improving detection pipeline that combines detection, optimization, and feedback. Experimental results across standard, adversarial, and cross-domain scenarios demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves an F1 score of 0.91 and reduces the false positive rate to 7.2%, significantly outperforming traditional static detection tools in both accuracy and resilience.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of 5G and mobile internet, various application fields continue to generate diverse dynamic streaming graphs with large scales and complex structures. Analyzing, querying and mining such a streaming graph face great challenges. To address the challenge of low query efficiency and avoid data loss, this paper proposes a two-stage coarsening method that preserves key features of a streaming graph while improves query efficiency. In the initial stage, the size of the streaming graph is not that large yet. To preserve its structure and attributes as much as possible, a linear mapping method is used for graph coarsening. As the size of the streaming graph increases, a graph neural network model based on cluster pooling is constructed in the second stage. Using a large number of graph coarsening results obtained in the initial stage to train and optimize this model. Then, we use this optimized model to obtain the subsequent summaries, which achieves online efficient graph coarsening. Finally, extensive experiments indicate that our algorithm significantly improves the quality of streaming graph coarsening compared to traditional algorithms. Even compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm Auxo, our algorithm shows a better performance on preserving key features.},

While previous research primarily addresses technical aspects, this paper highlights organizational factors that hinder the effectiveness of red teaming in real-world settings. Through qualitative analysis of 17 semi-structured interviews with red teamers from various organizations, we uncover challenges such as the marginalization of vulnerable red teamers, the invisibility of nuanced AI risks to vulnerable users until post-deployment, and the lack of user-centered red teaming approaches. These issues often arise from underlying organizational dynamics, including organizational resistance, organizational inertia, and organizational mediocracy. To mitigate these dynamics, we discuss the implications of user research for red teaming and the importance of embedding red teaming throughout the entire development cycle of GenAI systems.},

During entry, an adult generates an ID code via face detection and associates it with the child's information. During exit, a child can only pass if their ID code matches the associated adult's ID. Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves a recognition accuracy of 99.93%, a single binding time of 2.8 seconds, and a database response time of less than 10 ms under high concurrency (1000 QPS).

Existing solutions for trace reconstruction often fail to fully leverage available data, particularly in complex and high-dimensional contexts. Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence, particularly diffusion models, have set new benchmarks in image, audio, and natural language generation. This study conducts the first comprehensive evaluation of diffusion models for reconstructing incomplete trace event sequences. Using nine distinct datasets generated from the Phoronix Test Suite, we rigorously test these models on sequences of varying lengths and missing data ratios. Our results indicate that the SSSDS4 model, in particular, achieves superior performance, in terms of accuracy, perfect rate, and ROUGE-L score across diverse imputation scenarios. These findings underscore the potential of diffusion-based models to accurately reconstruct missing events, thereby maintaining data integrity and enhancing system monitoring and analysis.},

First, data augmentation is applied to the training data to alleviate common overfitting problems in few-shot scenarios. Second, consistency prototype learning is utilized to regularize the embedding space and address feature distortion. Additionally, a dual-teacher model for knowledge distillation is designed to prevent catastrophic forgetting of previously acquired knowledge. Experiments conducted on the TACRED dataset show that after completing all tasks under the 5-way-5-shot setting, accuracy improved by 2.22%.

Algorithmic governance has traditionally been defined in the literature as governance by algorithms, or how artificial intelligence is used to make governance decisions and affect social ordering. However, we take an alternative approach; instead, we conceptualize algorithmic governance as the governance of algorithms. We begin by summarizing the risks of generative AI use in government, then outline algorithmic governance principles, a step-by-step approach to implementing algorithmic governance into government or public sector projects, opportunities for inter-sector collaboration, and final conclusions.},

Approaching the problem from the perspective of multimodal transport operators within a defined network, the study integrates the stochastic travel time, stochastic transfer time, customer demands for timely delivery and the complexity of multiple orders. Combining with the high-value time-sensitive characteristics of consumer electronic products and taking the minimum of total cost as the optimization objective, we establish a multimodal transport path optimization model. In order to solve this model, a genetic algorithm with elite strategy based on Monte Carlo sampling is designed. Finally, we verify the validity of the model and algorithm through a specific case. And the case results are analyzed. The case results indicate that for the long-distance transportation of goods such as consumer electronics, which have a very high time-value cost, it is more appropriate to choose a multimodal transportation scheme based on road and railroad transportation, while waterway transportation does not have an advantage. In addition, further consideration of the uncertainty of the transportation time results in a transportation solution that ensures a higher probability of on-time delivery, while the total cost increases slightly but the transportation time decreases. The transportation scheme is more stable. The results of this paper provide a reference basis for the actual multimodal transportation path optimization problem of consumer electronics.},

  abstract = {We conduct an incentivized laboratory experiment to study people's perception of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) alignment in the context of economic decision-making. Using a panel of economic problems spanning the domains of risk, time preference, social preference, and strategic interactions, we ask human subjects to make choices for themselves and to predict the choices made by GenAI on behalf of a human user. These problems confront agents with trade-offs (e.g., higher payoff vs. earlier payoff, efficiency vs. equity, riskier but potentially higher rewards vs. safer but lower rewards) and the optimal choices depend on the agent's preferences. We find that people overestimate the degree to which GenAI choices are aligned with human preferences in general (anthropomorphic projection), and with their personal references in particular (self projection). On average, human subjects' predictions about GenAI's choices in every decision environment are much closer to the average human-subject choice than to the average GenAI choice. At the individual level, human subjects' predictions about GenAI's choices in a given environment are highly correlated with their own choices in the same environment.We explore the implications of anthropomorphic projection and self projection in a stylized theoretical model. Our theoretical analysis shows that anthropomorphic projection and self projection can lead to over-delegation to GenAI. More subtly, we also find that objectively improving AI alignment can harm agents who exhibit anthropomorphic projection (because they mistakenly adjust their delegation decisions in a detrimental fashion). Similarly, among agents who exhibit self projection, welfare may be higher for those who have more unusual preferences (since they are less likely to mistakenly delegate).The full paper can be found at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14708},

Advances in generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) further enrich these experiences by enabling adaptive learning pathways. However, evaluating such adaptive systems using traditional temporal metrics remains challenging due to the inherent variability in Gen-AI response times. To address this, our study employs multimodal behavioural metrics, including visual attention, physical exploratory behaviour, and verbal interaction, to assess user engagement in an adaptive VR environment. In a controlled experiment with (n = 54) participants, we compared three levels of adaptivity (high, moderate, and non-adaptive baseline) within a Neapolitan pizza-making VR experience. Results show that moderate adaptivity optimally enhances user engagement, significantly reducing unnecessary exploratory behaviour and increasing focused visual attention on the AI avatar. Our findings suggest that a balanced level of adaptive AI provides the most effective user support, offering practical design recommendations for future adaptive educational technologies.},

While advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) have shown promise in augmenting creativity and productivity, these tools are primarily designed for individual use and overlook group dynamics and the collaborative aspects of teamwork. This workshop will provide a platform for researchers and practitioners to explore the design of future human-AI groups across four key themes: (1) the role of GenAI in group settings, (2) collaborative and multimodal interactions with GenAI, (3) evaluating GenAI’s influence within groups and designing for appropriate reliance, and (4) evolving group practices in the presence of GenAI. We hope to build a community and construct alignment across participants around how to pursue research that understands how GenAI can augment, undermine, or bring new practices to collaborative settings and groupwork.},

However, we lack an understanding of how UX practitioners, UX teams, and companies actually utilize GenAI and what challenges they face. We conducted interviews with 24 UX practitioners from multiple companies and countries, with varying roles and seniority. Our findings include: 1) There is a significant lack of GenAI company policies, with companies informally advising caution or leaving the responsibility to individual employees; 2) UX teams lack team-wide GenAI practices. UX practitioners typically use GenAI individually, favoring writing-based tasks, but note limitations for design-focused activities, like wireframing and prototyping; 3) UX practitioners call for better training on GenAI to enhance their abilities to generate effective prompts and evaluate output quality. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for GenAI integration in the UX sector.},

  abstract = {Depression is a big public health problem around the world. Like the traditional methods of screening, clinical assessments, and self-rating scales are among the limits. These methods are based on the subjectivity of patient reports and the experience of doctors and clearly can have bias. In addition, they do not permit real-time monitoring of changes in mood. For this reason, this field of mental health is challenged with accurately and efficiently detecting probable mood changes in individuals at risk for depression. To resolve these challenges, we then propose a BERT-based sentimental analysis model adapted for depression-related text. Current methods for screening for traditional depression and established sentiment analysis models are hindered by data scarcity, data imbalance, and the problems of deriving emotional changes in a dynamic and clean manner. To leverage the strengths of BERTs in our model, we train the last layer of BERTs and then construct a classification layer tailored to the depressive emotion, which is more sensitive to the semantic information of the mood. Moreover, we also present data augmentation in its simplest form, which is the rearrangement of positive samples to increase the diversity of samples while still preserving the semantic meaning. To tackle data imbalance, we introduce a dynamic weight mechanism to the BCEWithLogitsLoss function by adjusting the weight of the positive samples with data distribution. The model effectively captures the complex emotional changes by combining global and local semantic dynamic representations. In our empirical study, we analyze the open-source dataset of interview transcripts of 162 volunteers. Our model is evaluated using the experimental results, and the precision, the recall rate, and the F1 score obtained are 0.667, 0.667, and 0.667, respectively. Our model has achieved 2.62 higher in terms of precision and F1 score as compared to the existing models. The results indicate that our model provides a big benefit in identifying screened individuals at risk for depression.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology, its application in game design is becoming increasingly widespread. This paper aims to explore how generative AI can enhance user experience by augmenting graphic art style game design. Through the study of design theories, those theories that have a strong influence on graphic art style games are identified. Next, the paper proposes a generative AI-based game design method that combines prompts confirmation, the setting of generated images, and user feedback optimization, aiming to enhance the aesthetic quality and interactivity of the game. To evaluate the effectiveness of the method, this paper designs and implements an interview method and a questionnaire to collect data and find out the user experience of generative AI-generated graphic art style games. The experimental results show that generative AI not only significantly improves the efficiency of game design, but also allows for innovative graphics and element design. The findings of this paper provide new perspectives and methods for the application of AI in future game design and also lay the foundation for further exploring the potential of generative AI in other art style games.},

Specifically, based on findings in Phases 1 and 2, we developed AskArt, an interactive interface that combines DALL-E and GPT and is tailored to support elementary school students in their art projects, and deployed it in Phases 3 and 4. Our findings revealed the benefits of GenAI in providing background information, inspirations, and personalized guidance. However, challenges in query formulation for generating expected content were also observed. Moreover, students employed varied collaboration strategies, and teachers noted increased engagement alongside concerns regarding misuse and interface suitability. This study offers insights into the effective integration of GenAI in elementary education, presents AskArt as a practical tool, and provides recommendations for educators and researchers to enhance project-based learning with GenAI technologies.},

However, research on time-series data in the transportation field, particularly on sequence prediction across multiple time scales, remains underexplored. To leverage the multi-scale characteristics of time-series data, as well as its seasonal and periodic features, we introduce two solutions based on DLinear model: multi-scale decomposition and cross-scale information fusion, and propose a traffic prediction model named MIFNetwork. We conduct comparative experiments on several traffic datasets, selecting transformer-based models with strong time-series modeling capabilities for comparison. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms other approaches, especially in handling long time spans and complex trend changes.},

  abstract = {The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Microsoft's Copilot, is transforming educational methodologies, including undergraduate physics courses for engineering students. Despite their potential, these LLMs typically rely on statistical learning methods and often exhibit algebraic inaccuracies in solving standard university-level physics problems. This study explores the use of LLMs in physics courses for N = 91 freshman engineering students over two academic terms (Spring and Fall 2023). Students engaged in AI-assisted activities to solve physics problems and were asked to identify and correct the errors made by the chatbot. The outcomes were compared with those from traditional teaching methods without AI involvement, and no significant difference in student learning gains was found. To assess the impact of AI tools in education, a more detailed approach using pre-test and post-test instruments&nbsp;with control and experimental groups is necessary. Survey results revealed, however, that AI-assisted sessions enhanced student engagement, problem-solving skills, and understanding of physics concepts. Students also indicated a strong preference for AI-assisted activities, citing increased motivation and a firm belief in the educational benefits of using these tools. Our findings suggest that well-designed AI interventions can effectively complement traditional instructional methods, especially when the LLMs are integrated with symbolic computational tools like WolframAlpha to improve their accuracy.},

Furthermore, AI’s authoritative tone and structured responses can create an illusion of correctness, leading to overtrust, especially among children. To address this, we developed AI Puzzlers, an interactive system based on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), to help children identify and analyze errors in genAI. Drawing on Mayer &amp; Moreno’s Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning, AI Puzzlers uses visual and verbal elements to reduce cognitive overload and support error detection. Based on two participatory design sessions with 21 children (ages 6 - 11), our findings provide both design insights and an empirical understanding of how children identify errors in genAI reasoning, develop strategies for navigating these errors, and evaluate AI outputs.},

Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been applied to emotion recognition due to its good temporal and spatial resolution. How to capture the correlation of long-distance time-series EEG signal data from both temporal and spatial dimensions and directly affect the effect of emotion recognition is a difficulty in the BCI research. Transformer model can extract long-term correlations of time-series signals. In this paper, a new electroencephalogram emotion recognition method based on spatiotemporal fusion Vision Transformer is proposed. The feature of EEG signals is reconstructed by the tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) method. The spatiotemporal correlation between the acquisition channel and the temporal signal is established by position coding for the convolved features. The hybrid model of multiscale convolutional and Vision Transformer (MC-ViT) is utilized for feature extraction and emotion classification.

  abstract = {As generative artificial intelligence (genAI) applications gain popularity, there is a dearth of research examining how applications may transform social interactions. One possible application set to transform social interactions is the use of generative speech to power AI agents that can realistically represent people. Our work examines the potential implications of AI agents representing individuals in human conversations ("agent representation") as a way to begin filling this research gap. We take a multi-method approach, conducting formative interviews with developers, a co-design workshop with designers, a harm analysis among researchers, and interviews with the general public. Both technologists and potential users worry adopting agent representations might harm the quality, trust, and autonomy of human communication. Potential users are particularly concerned that agent representations could undermine the value of social interaction and threaten individuals’ ability to control their image. To avoid such potential consequences, future genAI-powered agents and speech applications should take into account user-defined red lines when considering applying these technologies in social settings.},

  abstract = {One common data augmentation method used in text image recognition is color shift transformations. A widely used method is the Variational Color Shift (VCS), which can automatically predict a range of color shifts for each image. The algorithm has significant overfitting when applied to text images that are highly interfered with and contain noise, which hinders further improvements in text recognition accuracy. In this study, we submit a new transformed layer inside the VCS framework using cyclic boundary shifts over the text images. A new module, Transformed Variational Color Shift (TVCS) is proposed. This method integrates a generalized set of colors (the original dataset) in a manner that can transform the input dataset. The experimental results show that TVCS has superior recognition accuracy than VCS and has better robustness against interference. The algorithm proposed is innovative as the data augmentation of text images, especially in a noisy environment.},

  abstract = {Most current generative models for anomaly detection, which rely on reconstruction methods, primarily use either Variational Autoencoders or Generative Adversarial Networks. However, VAEs tend to suffer from poor reconstruction quality, while GANs face challenges related to training stability and limited pattern coverage. Additionally, due to privacy and security concerns, the available training data for anomaly detection is often limited, whereas generative models typically require large datasets to avoid the risk of overfitting. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an unsupervised anomaly detection model utilizing diffusion techniques, designed specifically for tabular data, using a reconstruction-based approach. We adopt the diffusion model as the backbone for anomaly detection, aiming to enhance reconstruction quality and ensure training stability. To further improve reconstruction quality and accelerate inference, we employ a truncated diffusion strategy during inference. What's more, to overcome the challenge of insufficient training data, we introduce a SMOTE-based data augmentation method optimized for feature space in tabular data, incorporating a VAE to address the limitations of the original SMOTE algorithm in capturing complex data structures and handling nonlinear relationships. Experimental results on real-world datasets validate that our method achieves higher detection accuracy compared to conventional methods, demonstrating its effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Existing multimodal knowledge graph reasoning methods often rely on simple weighted averaging or attention mechanisms for multimodal feature fusion, which frequently results in the loss of modality-specific information and fails to fully exploit the complementary relationships between modalities. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multimodal knowledge graph reasoning method based on a cross-attention mechanism. The model employs the BERT model to encode textual information, introduces a VGG-16 model with a multi-scale attention module to encode visual information, and utilizes a graph attention mechanism to extract the structural information of the knowledge graph. Additionally, a contrastive learning framework is introduced to reduce semantic inconsistencies between modalities, and a cross-attention mechanism is used to achieve dynamic feature fusion across modalities. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, comparative experiments were conducted on the FB15k-237 and DB15K datasets. The results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing benchmark models on key evaluation metrics such as MRR, Hit@1, Hit@3, and Hit@10, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in multimodal knowledge graph reasoning.},

Applications of reactive synthesis span various domains, including robot motion planning, autonomous system control, and communication protocol development. This paper investigates the reactive synthesis for formulas expressed in Real-Time Linear Dynamic Logic over finite traces (RTLDLf). RTLDLf is more expressive than Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf). While RTLDLf and Linear Dynamic Logic over finite traces (LDLf) share equivalent expressive power, RTLDLf offers greater simplicity in its logical constructs compared to LDLf. Existing synthesis methods for LDLf predominantly rely on automata-based approaches. In this paper, we propose an RTLDLf synthesis method based on temporal testers. We first translate an RTLDLf specification into a temporal tester, a non-deterministic transducer. The tester is then transformed into a graph game between the system and the environment. We finally propose a symbolic algorithm to solve the game to derive a winning strategy for the system player. The proposed method has two advantages: (1) high composability, enabling convenient and efficient synthesis of complex RTLDLf formulas, and (2) symbolic representation of the tester's transition relations and state space, which facilitates the use of efficient symbolic algorithms based on Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams.},

However, as the increasing number of websites, users now often come across the issues of password overload. Such repeated use of one's passwords or choosing simple passwords such as names or dates could lead to serious security risks. Password-guessing simulations could effectively prevent these vulnerabilities. Nowadays, most modern websites request passwords with special characters to enhance their complexity. This study emphasizes the special characters within passwords. By using t-SNE visualization and KL divergence, we have analyzed the distribution of these characters among different passwords visually and quantitatively. As the result shows, special characters present a unique distribution mode in t-SNE visualization, with a higher KL divergence value than alphabetic and digit segments. Based on our findings, a password-guessing approach that classified the special character segments into four types according to the position named the Pos-PCFG model has been proposed. The model has improved the guessing accuracy of multiple datasets. In the Rockyou dataset test, accuracy was achieved with a notable 0.98% increase when guessing passwords consisting of special characters.},

  abstract = {Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) aims to address incomplete facts in Knowledge Graphs (KGs). As a mainstream approach for KGC, text-based methods are limited in performance due to insufficient knowledge caused by constraints in fine-tuning data. To incorporate broader external knowledge, some researchers explored KGC approaches based on large language models (LLMs), but general-purpose LLMs lack direct awareness of knowledge graph domain knowledge, making it challenging for them to independently perform KGC tasks. To balance the dependence of text-based methods on knowledge graph domain knowledge and LLMs on external knowledge, we propose Collaborative Enhancement using Large Language Model for KGC (ColKGC). We define the prompt template to implement the interaction between the text-based model and the LLMs, and divide the knowledge graph completion process into two stages. In the concept enhancement stage, we supplement the fine-tuning data by interacting with the prompts of the LLMs to enrich the graph domain knowledge learned by the text-based model. In completion inference stage, we adopted the iterative interaction strategy, taking the text-based model output as the prompt and taking the interaction content of the previous stage as the context to enhance the inference, which improved the LLMs' understanding of the KGC task. Our experiments demonstrate that ColKGC achieves superior results across various standard knowledge graph benchmarks. Extensive experiments also bear out ColKGC's efectiveness in generated data and the iterative interaction framework in assisting LLMs reasoning.},

To best of our knowledge, few studies have explored auto detection of sleep spindles based on crowdsourced datasets. MODA is the only crowdsourcing spindle annotation open access dataset until now, and this study utilized the MODA dataset to further enhance the automatic detection of sleep spindles using conventional neural network (CNN) and innovative label optimization module. To evaluate our model, we proposed and conducted two analysis methods including analysis by sample-event and by subject. Meanwhile, to validate our performance of our model, SUMO and EXP were considered as control and gold standard methods respectively; and various metrics related to by sample-event and by subject were compared among our model, SUMO and EXP. The results from analysis by sample-event showed that F1 score, Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC), and Cohen's Kappa coefficient in our model were significantly higher than in SUMO under all overlap thresholds. Specifically, under a higher threshold of 0.6, F1, MCC and Kappa reached 0.82, 0.81, 0.81 in our model, 0.75, 0.74, 0.74 in SUMO, respectively. For analysis by subject, all spindle features extraction of our model were comparable to the EXP, including density (4.48 in our model vs 3.80 in EXP), duration (0.79 vs 0.84), amplitude (29.91 vs 30.09) and frequency (13.04 vs 12.92). However, the spindle density extracted by SUMO was significantly different from EXP (9.04 in SUMO vs 3.80 in EXP). In conclusion, our results suggested that the crowdsourced public dataset and label optimization module can further enhance the spindle detection capability of the convolutional neural network.},

Aiming at the problems of traditional algorithms in UAV path planning, such as local optima trapping and low convergence accuracy, this hybrid algorithm combines the advantages of both algorithms. The Fuch and Logistic chaotic maps are used for population initialization to enhance the global search ability. During the optimization process, the DBO algorithm's strong local exploitation ability and the GWO algorithm's global search characteristics are coordinated. A B\'{e}zier curve is employed to smooth the planned path. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid algorithm outperforms traditional algorithms in terms of path length, convergence speed, and path smoothness, validating its effectiveness in UAV three-dimensional path planning.},

Enhancing the capability for early warning of online public opinion crises is urgent. The most effective approach is to identify potential crises in their early stages and implement corresponding management measures. This study establishes a preliminary indicator system for online public opinion early warning, based on the principles of indicator system construction and the characteristics and evolution patterns of online public opinion. Subsequently, data-driven methodologies were employed to collect and preprocess public opinion indicator data. Utilizing grey relational analysis and the K-Means clustering algorithm, we classified online public opinion events into three levels: slight, warning, and severe. Furthermore, we constructed an online topic evolution model using the online Hierarchical Dirichlet Process model to analyze the thematic changes of online public opinion events across different warning levels. Finally, we developed an online public opinion early warning model using a Backpropagation (BP) neural network. The test results of early warning samples show that the model achieves high accuracy. Thus, in practical early warning applications, the BP neural network can be effectively utilized for predicting online public opinion events.},

As the key technology of this problem, recommendation algorithm has become an important tool in the information age.

To solve these problems, this paper proposes a fusion Group behavior characteristics and time series characteristics of the recommendation algorithm model Group-Temporal Recommendation Fusion (GTRF). Based on deep learning algorithm, the model extracts group behavioral characteristics by using graph attention network to deal with the problem of cold start, obtains time series characteristics by using gated convolution and GRU to deal with the problem of dynamic changes in user behavior, and finally uses cross-attention mechanism to effectively integrate these two types of features to achieve high-precision prediction of recommended content. GTRF not only solves the problems such as cold start of new users and dynamic change of user behavior, but also significantly improves the comprehensive performance of recommendation algorithm, showing the indispensable and great potential of recommendation algorithm in information retrieval.},

However, during the training process, models may memorize sensitive private data, posing risks to data security and privacy protection. Member Inference Attacks (MIA) aim to determine whether a specific record was used in the training of the target model. This approach is crucial for detecting privacy risks in models and has seen substantial progress in both traditional and fine-tuned models. However, this remains an unresolved issue for large language models (LLMs). Recent studies indicate that under proper experimental setups, the AUC-ROC of existing methods approaches 0.5 (random guessing). Subsequently, some research has shifted MIA to dataset inference, achieving promising results in this area. Our study shows that when fine-tuning a target model with aggregated samples, it is possible to distinguish whether these samples were used in training the target model by observing the initial loss returned by the model. Based on this observation, we propose a fine-tuning-based member inference method for large language models. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted extensive experiments on three mainstream models and seven datasets. The results indicate that member inference attacks with aggregated samples can achieve acceptable outcomes.},

  abstract = {With the continuous development of blockchain technology, an increasing number of scholars have begun to consider the harm of data leakage during on-chain transactions and the requirement for privacy data protection. Zero-knowledge range proof, as a cryptographic technology, can perform legitimacy verification of data while hiding private data, effectively realizing the protection of private data on the blockchain, so it is increasingly used to protect blockchain privacy. The mainstream construction methods for range proofs can be mainly divided into two categories: n-ary decomposition and square decomposition. This paper introduces and analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of these construction methods in detail. Then, based on these two methods, a zero-knowledge range proof scheme based on multibit split square decomposition (ZKRPMSSD) is proposed, which requires no trusted third-party setting and can achieve range proofs for arbitrary ranges. The proposed ZKRPMSSD scheme processes the original data based on the multibit split idea, and the acquisition method of secret value components is optimized so that the acquisition of components does not depend on the scale of the original problem. Additionally, the algorithms for proof generation and verification in the ZKRPMSSD scheme are redesigned based on the (Sigma ) protocol and Pedersen commitments, effectively reducing the computational cost of the proof generation and verification process. Finally, typical n-ary decomposition and square decomposition zero-knowledge range proof construction schemes are taken for comparative analysis. Under 256-bit security and the same problem scale, experimental results indicate that ZKRPMSSD has advantages in proof and verification time costs.},

  abstract = {Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved significant progress and been widely applied across various industries. However, a series of significant challenges have also been posed, such as the hallucination, where the generated attributes of a target are inconsistent with the information in the image. Recent works have primarily focused on improving generation performance by training the multimodal alignment module of the model with additional data. However, this approach incurs higher costs and introduces redundant information due to the reliance on large amounts of additional data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal mitigation framework, termed MH-PEFT. Specifically, we introduce an effective data augmentation strategy that leverages existing data to generate additional attribute-related information, thereby enhancing the model's generative capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a PEFT-based training approach specifically tailored to mitigate multimodal hallucination in LVLMs. Notably, our framework features a plug-and-play design, which enhances its robustness and facilitates its deployment in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets.},

  abstract = {This study presents the development of an automated annotation tool for energy industries such as power, leveraging large language models to address challenges in processing unstructured text data efficiently and accurately. The tool comprises two main subsystems: data cleaning and preprocessing, and data generation. The data cleaning subsystem normalizes multi-format documents, converting them into structured formats suitable for annotation. The data generation subsystem, based on a large language model, includes modules for text, table, terminology, and image annotation, enabling the automatic generation of diverse question-answer pairs. The tool's performance was evaluated on 574 documents of eight common types of documents. Results show the tool's strong annotation capability, achieving high accuracy and coverage rates. However, limitations were observed in areas such as term recognition, context understanding, and multimodal content handling, highlighting avenues for future improvement. This automated annotation tool offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for data annotation in the power industry and lays the groundwork for enhancing data-driven decision-making and knowledge extraction across similar industries.},

Here, the use of deep learning technologies brings up the problem of single-label classification methods that may not be able to deal with the multi-label one as they do not cover the complex, sometimes coexisting, multiple-pathological features in medical images. To address these challenges, we propose the CTTransNet speculative model, a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), which aims to better integrate the local features and the global context. Similarly, a Transformer decoder is used to model inter-label dependencies, and a less-weighted fusing loss mechanism is utilized to deal with the data imbalance issue. The AUC of 81.68% on the ChestXray14 dataset is achieved by the proposed method, which shows its higher accuracy and superiority to the robustness compared to the traditional methods in multi-label medical image classification. This breakthrough thus brings about the complete information needed for a clinical diagnosis and makes it easier for personalized precision medicine to develop.},

The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper improves the detection accuracy and speed compared with the traditional DETR in the aircraft detection task, especially in the complex background with better robustness and generalization ability.

Regrettably, the Apriori algorithm is not only the most classical algorithm, but also has some weaknesses, for instance, it has high computational complexity, generates too many candidate itemsets, which in turn leads it to be mainly used in small-scale educational data scenarios only. In this paper, the authors propose a modified version of the Apriori algorithm which aims to the rule generation process and the computational operation more efficient through data preprocessing phase information improvement and using the dynamic thresholding adjusting component as well as a not-so-well-known intelligent technique. The usefulness of the improved algorithm is tested by an experiment with actual course performance assessments, and the algorithm is also applied in the educational decision support system which comprises the course recommendation, teaching strategy optimization, and academic risk prediction the students. The results of the study suggest that there are no gains in script execution speed, generalization rate, or memory usage while there are with great advantage in the run time of the proposed algorithm.

Most existing methods focus on traditional abnormal signals and can achieve high detection rates through training and testing of neural network models. However, the presence of adversarial samples greatly reduces the performance of existing network models. To address this issue, a spectrum anomaly detection algorithm based on attention mechanism residual neural network is proposed, which can significantly improve the robustness of network models without adversarial training. This method integrates the attention mechanism module and the Residual Network (ResNet), using ResNet18 to process spectrogram data, avoiding gradient vanishing and overfitting during iteration, and using attention mechanism to enhance the model's attention to local information in spectrogram data. The experimental results show that the predictive performance of the proposed algorithm is superior to the compared algorithms. Compared with ResNet18 and feature transformation based image retrieval adversarial defense algorithms, the new algorithm has increased the AUC value for abnormal signal detection by approximately 47% and 24%, respectively, effectively improving the robustness of the network model and reducing the negative impact of adversarial samples on the neural network model. The experimental results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the residual neural network model based on attention mechanism.},

  abstract = {While educational researchers in various disciplines are grappling with how to develop policies and pedagogical approaches that address the use of generative artificial intelligence, the challenge is particularly complex in computer science education where the new technology is changing the core of the field. In this paper, we take a look at the pedagogy of other subjects with a longer history than computer science and a more extensive body of educational research to collect insights on how this challenge can be met. We begin by drawing from recent neurological research to find domains that share cognitive commonalities with computer programming and then build upon comparisons that others have made to literacy and mathematics education. We then consider how the "reading wars" and "math wars" have shaped these fields, which we see as conflicts between less effective top-down pedagogy and more effective bottom-up pedagogy, and reflect on what would be comparable approaches in teaching computing. We find that approaches that make heavy use of large language models without teaching fundamentals can be compared to the top-down pedagogy of reading and mathematics and are likely to be ineffective on their own. Therefore, we advise against the exclusive use of such approaches with novices. However, we also acknowledge that the social science surrounding computer science education is complex and that effectiveness only tells a part of the story, with other factors such as engagement, motivation and social dynamics also being important.},

However, the performance of these models is constrained by their reliance on a single graph construction approach. To enhance detection accuracy and adaptability to intricate attack patterns, this paper introduces a Multi-Granularity Graph Fusion-based Graph Neural Network (MGF-GNN) model. The model resolves the issue of a single granularity graph structure failing to fully capture the complex relationships and covert attack strategies in network traffic. It constructs three heterogeneous graphs at different granularities to capture traffic relationships from host-level, port-level, and protocol-level perspectives. The model employs hierarchical message passing, aggregation, and cross-graph information fusion mechanisms to strengthen its ability to learn multi-level information, thereby improving detection performance against complex attacks. MGF-GNN outperforms traditional machine learning methods and single-graph-based GNN models on the CIC-IDS2017 and UNSW-NB15 datasets, achieving significant improvements across multiple evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Its effectiveness is primarily attributed to MGF-GNN's ability to comprehensively learn multi-dimensional perspective information through multi-granularity graph fusion.},

The rise of deep learning technologies has spurred the development of methods to accelerate MRI reconstruction. In this regard, we introduce a novel cold-diffusion-based approach to accelerate MRI reconstruction. This method leverages the Swin Transformer architecture for effective feature extraction and incorporates a high-frequency self-attention mechanism to improve the recovery of high-frequency components, thus enhancing image quality. Unlike traditional diffusion models that rely on Gaussian noise, our cold-diffusion model simulates data loss through specific degradation processes like Cartesian undersampling. Experimental results demonstrate that the Swin-CDMR approach outperforms existing techniques in reconstruction quality, achieving superior structural similarity index (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) scores while maintaining robustness across varying acceleration factors (AF).},

Firstly, the clustering task is accomplished with the help of Gaussian hybrid clustering algorithm on the entities in the security vulnerability knowledge graph to label the entities with clusters. In the next step, the clustered vulnerability entities are reclassified using support vector machine.

  abstract = {As the scale of agricultural production continues to expand, plant diseases have become a major threat to global agricultural productivity. Although traditional disease detection methods are widely used, they generally suffer from low accuracy and complex operations, making them difficult to meet the needs of modern agriculture. In response to these problems, this article proposes a new deep learning model-LabInt. LabInt uses dual-branch independent convolution in Lab color space, which effectively reduces the impact of illumination changes on feature extraction. Through spatial reconstruction and multi-scale pooling technology, the model can deeply mine shallow disease features and use deep convolution instead of ordinary convolution to reduce computational costs and improve the model's fine-grained identification capabilities. In addition, in order to adapt to complex agricultural environments, LabInt introduces a multi-head self-attention (MHA) mechanism to dynamically enhance attention to disease characteristics and significantly reduce the interference of complex backgrounds. Experimental results show that LabInt exhibits excellent disease recognition performance in actual agricultural production environments, with key indicators such as precision and recall reaching high levels. Ablation studies show that each module makes an important contribution to model performance. Therefore, LabInt is not only innovative in theory, but also shows strong application potential in practice, and is expected to become an important tool to improve the efficiency of agricultural disease prevention and control.},

First, a new residual hybrid attention module (RHAB) is constructed, which is serially combined with multiple self-attention (MSA) to enhance feature extraction by mixing channel attention (CA), spatial attention (SA), and MSA, and to improve the model's ability in modeling locally and globally relevant information.

  abstract = {Accurate segmentation of brain tumors is essential for clinical assessment and treatment planning, as it leverages multiple MRI modalities to provide complementary diagnostic information. However, missing modalities are frequently en- countered in clinical practice due to factors such as image degradation, artifacts, protocol inconsistencies, or patient con- traindications to contrast agents. While certain unified models are designed to accommodate various missing modality scenarios, their performance declines markedly when multiple modalities are absent, particularly in cases where only a single modality is available. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a Guided- learning Network that leverages dynamic FFT filters. This network trains multiple specialized models designed for different missing modality scenarios, achieving outstanding performance. The architecture comprises two distinct learning paths: one dedicated to capturing multimodal information and another focused on generating modality-specific representations for the missing modality. A guided-learning strategy connects these two paths. Initially, the multimodal path is trained and its parameters are locked, enabling the missing modality path to learn under its guidance. The training process incorporates several key com- ponents: adversarial learning to align high-level features across paths, frequency-domain adaptive filtering using dynamic FFT filters to extract global features, and mutual information transfer to ensure critical information is retained even when modality data is missing. Experiments conducted on the BraTS2018 dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms comparable state-of- the-art methods in all missing modality cases.},

  abstract = {Audio-driven talking-face synthesis is of significant importance in various application scenarios, such as remote meetings, AR/VR, and digital humans. Currently, the work in this field can be broadly divided into two categories: implicit representation-based methods and explicit representation-based methods. Implicit representation-based methods often use neural network models to represent human face. For example, NeRF (Neural Radiance Field) uses MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) to represent human face, and by inputting the camera pose, NeRF renders a face image from that viewpoint. When training with audio features, it can render face images with different facial movements. However, due to the lack of editability and slow rendering speed of implicit representations, the industry has been exploring new representation methods. Explicit representation-based methods commonly use 3D Gaussian representations of the face, which offers high editability and nearly real-time rendering speed, making these methods surpass implicit-based approaches in many metrics. However, it is difficult to incorporate other signals during the rendering optimization process. To address this issue, this paper combines 3D Gaussian representations with the 3D head model FLAME (Faces Learned with an Articulated Model and Expressions). The FLAME model represents the face's shape and facial movements with a set of parameters. In this paper, audio signals are first transformed into parameters representing facial movements, which are used to initialize the 3D model generated by the parameters, followed by rendering optimization. This paper proposes a 3D Gaussian-based audio-driven lip-sync video generation system. It consists of two main modules: the audio-to-facial movement module and the 3D Gaussian rendering module. The audio-to-facial movement module uses the extracted audio features to generate parameters that control the FLAME model, converting the audio input into natural and reasonable lip shapes and facial movements. The 3D Gaussian rendering module initializes the 3D Gaussian with the FLAME model, optimizes the rendered image from coarse to fine, and finally stitches the generated images together to create a continuous video. Experiments show that this system can generate lip-synchronized, accurate, high-fidelity videos.},

Traditional MARL algorithms often struggle with these two critical issues. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework called DDCF(Dynamic Decision Correction Framework) that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to optimize the decision-making process for agents navigating complex environments. The first key innovation of this framework is the application of LSTM networks, which enable agents to learn optimal paths over time while considering dynamic, temporal dependencies within the environment. The second key innovation is the introduction of a dynamic decision-making approach, which effectively handles the problem of incomplete information by enabling agents to make decisions based on both observable and inferred states. This decision method ensures that agents can intelligently handle uncertain environments by incorporating both certain and fuzzy information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of path optimization and decision-making performance, providing a robust solution for agents in environments characterized by incomplete information and complex decision tasks.},

The study takes five major roads (West Beijing Road, North Taiping Road, Changjiang Road, Yihe Road, and Central Road) in Nanjing as objects, and based on the streetscape and remote sensing data of the vegetation growth season from 2017 to 2022, the Gaussian noise, motion blur, and weather effects are simulated by the multimodal noise addition technique, which effectively improves the adaptability of the model to the dynamic interference. The experiments showed that the Green View Index analysis revealed a general upward trend of street greening (average increase of 0.94%). Furthermore, the Kendall rank correlation analysis reveals the positive correlation between environmental factors and green visualization rate, and the influence law of environmental factors on green perception is verified. This study provides a high-precision computer vision analysis framework for urban greening planning and promotes the application of semantic segmentation models in complex urban scenes.},

  abstract = {An adaptive fast robust scaled consensus tracking problem for multi-agent systems (MASs) with unknown dynamics is studied in this paper under a directed graph. Each agent's dynamic is described by a high-order differential equation, which includes time delays and uncertainty. A novel fully distributed adaptive control method is proposed to ensure that all following agents track the leader with prescribed scaled ratios asymptotically, and the tracking errors are uniform ultimate boundedness. Meantime the proposed approach guarantees the bounded adaptive estimates of the unknown parameters and dynamics, and can lighten the burden on computation because it only needs to update a small number of adaptive parameters. The control gain of each agent is heterogeneous and time-varying. It changes and updates by the designed distributed adaptive law. The presented protocol doesn't need to know global nonzero eigenvalues of communication graph adjacency matrix, and is independent of any global information. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical results is verified by a numerical example.},

However, these models are heavily dependent on the size and quality of the training corpus and exhibit poor performance when faced with unknown errors. Inspired by adversarial learning, this paper focuses on Chinese character input scenarios and propose an effective attack strategy to generate more valuable training examples in these scenarios. This strategy jointly utilizes the attention mechanism and the logit output to determine the attack position and generates misspelling instances in a perturbed pinyin manner. The generated adversarial samples are then gradually added to the training set to train the model. Further, this paper explores the effect of the proportion of samples in the adversarial training process on model performance.

It also aims to explore whether a machine learning-based chat agent is capable of accomplishing all the tasks precisely, or whether it could be optimized by collaborating with other simple agents. This paper establishes a chatbot environment along with a series of agents (machine learning agent, grammar checker agent, spelling checker agent, restaurant searcher), designed to assist users in finding a restaurant mainly based on what transportation they use and if a restaurant is found, the chatbot could display the route to this place in the prompt also with map details by employing the Google map API. The machine learning agent acting as the brain of this chatbot, could not only be able to evoke other agents corresponding to users’ input but also could directly store what kinds of transportation are taken by users and pass to Google map API to search appropriate restaurants instead of fully relying on a restaurant searcher agent (rule-based agent). To examine whether multiple agents coordinate with each other could outperform a single agent. A contrast experiment is conducted to conclude the result, which involves 15 participants who run through this program under two different setups (with and without spelling and grammar checkers) and each of them would give a query to this chatbot but this query would be dealt with and without spelling and grammar checker respectively. The result would be quantitatively evaluated by two metrics: Success Rate: successfully finding a restaurant and showing the map; the Total of Queries. Results suggest that pre-processing input with spelling and grammar checkers significantly improves the chatbot's performance, achieving an 80% success rate (12 out of 15 queries). In contrast, when input is not pre-processed, the success rate drops to 46.66% (7 out of 15 queries). This indicates that the involvement of spelling and grammar checker agents enhances the accuracy and efficiency of restaurant searches, making the collaborative multi-agent setup more effective. Moreover, it could demonstrate that this chatbot environment is well constructed since it could successfully provide suitable restaurants given users’ requirements.},

However, our framework aims to preserve the large language model generation capability while focusing on the implicit relationships in configurations. By introducing a hierarchical command graph, we follow a top-down matching to generate templates, reducing feedback interactions in generation and bring potential solutions for automated provisioning. We process template generation under different scenarios, including establishing BGP basic connections on multiple routers and imposing restrictions such as route redistribution at specific locations. Human involvement is restricted to providing critical information. Experiment shows that expected templates can be generated in the first iteration, particularly for the basic task. The advanced task is influenced by multiple factors, however, it still shows considerable potential in terms of coverage with possibly feasible templates.},

  abstract = {With the wide deployment of deep learning models in various applications, the reliability problem of neural networks has gradually become a research hotspot. Computer systems are susceptible to single-particle effects, electromagnetic interference, and other factors in complex environments, resulting in frequent bit-flipping faults. Among them, Silent Data Corruption (SDC), as an imperceptible fault, cannot be detected by the system, which ultimately destroys the output results of neural network models. Current SDC detection techniques mainly focus on the system instruction stream level, and lack efficient methods to implement detection reinforcement at the model level. In addition, due to the black-box weight update mechanism of neural networks, traditional selective redundancy methods cannot provide a reliable explanation of which important weights to fix. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Convolutional Neural Network Reinforcement Framework Based on Neural Network Interpretability (RFNI). RFNI explores the redundancy ratio of convolutional kernels by performing layer-by-layer search in convolutional neural networks through SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) agent; secondly, the importance of each convolutional kernel in the current layer is calculated by combining with neural network interpretability algorithms; and finally, the importance of each convolutional kernel in the current layer is calculated based on the total Floating Point Operations Per Second (FLOPS). Second, the importance of each convolutional kernel in the current layer is calculated by combining with the neural network interpretable algorithm; finally, the granularity configurable redundancy reinforcement is implemented based on the total floating point operations per second (FLOPS). The experimental results show that RFNI on multiple neural network architectures significantly improves the recognition accuracy in case of SDC over existing methods, and can effectively enhance the robustness of the model.},

A novel approach to this problem is the Trend Decomposition Enhanced Large Language Model for Non-Static Network Traffic Prediction (TD-LLM). Applying trend decomposition as the preparation approach, the proposed strategy first divides raw information into resolved and non-fixed parts. The predetermined portion is standardized and processed, implementing a multi-head cross-attention mechanism, while a better self-attention mechanism improves the non-stationary element. Prompt engineering is used to create specially designed causes that serve as a guideline for the design throughout the forecast process. Finally, the processed data and creates are integrated into the large language model to produce the predicted results. In contrast to foundation models like Time- LLM, LSTM, Informer, and Transformer, the TD-LLM type drastically reduces mean squared error for network traffic prediction across many regions, according to exploratory evaluations, with decreases of 19.73 %, 54.71 %, 76.88 %, and 61.48 %, respectively.},

However, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography provides advantages such as convenience and a wide perspective, gradually replacing these conventional techniques for traffic video collection. Nonetheless, challenges including complex scenes, varying scales and frequent occlusions result in issues such as false positives, missed targets, and identity switches (IDSW). To tackle these, we developed the UVD detection algorithm based on YOLOv8-n and the AByteTrack tracking algorithm derived from ByteTrack. The integration of these two components forms the UVD-ATrack algorithm. In the backbone of the detection section, we introduced the RFAConv and designed RF_C2f to enhance feature extraction capabilities. For the neck component, the adaptive weight fusion module (AWFM) was developed to effectively combine multi-scale local information. During the tracking phase, we optimized the motion model. Additionally, camera motion compensation (CMC) was implemented to adaptively mitigate the effects of sharp perspective changes. Test results utilizing the Visdrone dataset indicate that mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.5:0.95 improved by 4.4% and 3.6% respectively in the detection section. In the tracking test, IDF1, HOTA, MOTA and MOTP also exhibited significant enhancement while IDSW decreased by 77%.

  abstract = {As deep learning technology in computer science develops, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has shown great potential in automated essay scoring (AES). Prompts and time are important factors which may influence the performance of GenAI. The study selected 52 English argumentative essays, designed five different prompts, chooses two different time points, and then utilized ChatGPT 4 to explore the effects of prompts and time on AES by GenAI. Besides, possible reasons for large difference between human and GenAI score were discussed.For different prompts, results show that the one-shot prompt performs better in AES compared with the other four prompts. It provides background information and a scoring example to ChatGPT. The scores generated by it do not significantly differ from the human scores. They significantly and positively correlate with human scores (ρ = 0.424). The exact-plus-adjacent agreement (EPAA) rate for one-shot prompt scores reaches 69.23%. For scores generated at different points in time, results reveal that although there is still a significant difference between scores generated after one week and human scores, the ChatGPT-Human EPAA rate becomes higher and the absolute value of mean score difference is smaller.Based on the analysis of selected essays, the major reason for large GenAI-Human score difference is that ChatGPT evaluates essays from limited perspectives to give its score, while human raters can comprehensively assess the quality of an essay. What's more, ChatGPT cannot keep the same scoring criteria during the rating process.The study aims to help people understand how to interact with GenAI more efficiently and take advantage of GenAI to meet the practical needs.},

Intelligent processing of ancient texts, as an essential part of digital humanities, is also undergoing a transformation in research methodologies in the wave of AIGC. The integration of generative pre-trained models with Chinese ancient texts, a vital carrier of Chinese culture, allows for deep mining of the content of these texts and provides services that make ancient texts more understandable and accessible to the general public. In this research, we propose a method that combines the most renowned Chinese anthology, the “Siku Quanshu,” with generative pre-trained models. We developed the SikuGPT model, a generative model for ancient text processing tasks, based on GPT-type language models by continued pretraining. This model was tested on two typical tasks of ancient text processing: translation between classical and modern Chinese, and classification of ancient texts. The findings reveal that our model achieves advantages in understanding and generating scenarios of ancient texts. The capability of SikuGPT in processing traditional Chinese texts helps to promote the organization of ancient information and knowledge services, and advances the international dissemination of traditional Chinese culture.},

Traditional contact-based measurement methods face significant limitations in high temperature and extreme environments, such as safety risks, inaccurate measurements due to interference with the environment, and short equipment life. To address these challenges, this study proposes an innovative non-contact measurement method using a visual depth estimation technique based on deep learning. The MiDaS model captures an image of a liquid metal surface by a monocular camera in an industrial environment. A deep neural network then estimates their depth by processing these images. By calculating the vertical distance between the liquid metal level point and a predefined reference point, real-time and accurate monitoring of the liquid level height is realized. This study not only introduces a new non-contact solution for measuring the height of liquid metal surfaces, but also enhances the potential applications of deep learning in industrial vision measurement and depth estimation.},

This paper explores the role of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in technology sovereignty, its contributions, and benefits for the government, associated risks, and challenges, and how it influences government policies. It begins with examining GAI's capabilities to comprehend how it understands natural language, trains on existing data, and generates realistic outputs, followed by a discussion of its potential benefits for governments that enable them to act independently and autonomously in diverse sectors. It highlights how it can empower them to administer technological ecosystems, promote domestic innovation, and facilitate policy-making processes. However, contrary to its benefits, GAI is also capable of inflicting negative consequences on society. Therefore, the paper also addresses the risks and challenges associated with GAI that necessitate reflection on existing policies and developing new ones that align with a nation's legal frameworks. Exploring the influence of GAI on government policies, the paper highlights the significance of collaboration in policy-making endeavors to ensure ethical future developments and bring value to public interest and democratic values. This comprehensive analysis aims to shed light on the responsible and ethical use of GAI to preserve human rights, promote economic growth, sustain social justice, and inform the responsible use of GAI within the framework of technology sovereignty.},

The nature of different families and classes of malware images is imbalanced, which leads to a challenging issue of biased classification, where the majority classes dominate the model's performance. Attention is drawn to generative artificial intelligence, in which a generative adversarial network (GAN) is used to synthesize more training samples (particularly in minority classes). A more balanced dataset can reduce biased classification towards the majority class. However, a robust GAN model usually requires high computing power and a lot of epochs. In this paper, we aim to design a lightweight GAN model to enhance the performance of malware image classification in imbalanced datasets. Performance evaluation and analysis show that it enhances the model's accuracy and reduces its training time. Future research directions are also shared.},

The primary focus was on identifying both the positive and negative aspects of the method, as well as delineating the computational thinking characteristics developed during the process. The results indicate that the use of ChatGPT facilitated the learning of refactoring, contributing to the development of numerous computational thinking skills, especially problem formulation, decomposition, and abstraction. Thus, this paper contributes a GAI-based teaching method along with evidence on how it helps students develop refactoring skills.},

  abstract = {The systematic testing of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models by collaborative teams and distributed individuals, often called red-teaming, is a core part of the infrastructure that ensures that AI models do not produce harmful content. Unlike past technologies, the black box nature of generative AI systems necessitates a uniquely interactional mode of testing, one in which individuals on red teams actively interact with the system, leveraging natural language to simulate malicious actors and solicit harmful outputs. This interactional labor done by red teams can result in mental health harms that are uniquely tied to the adversarial engagement strategies necessary to effectively red team. The importance of ensuring that generative AI models do not propagate societal or individual harm is widely recognized—one less visible foundation of end-to-end AI safety is also the protection of the mental health and wellbeing of those who work to keep model outputs safe. In this paper, we argue that the unmet mental health needs of AI red-teamers are a critical workplace safety concern. Through analyzing the unique mental health impacts associated with the labor done by red teams, we propose potential individual and organizational strategies that could be used to meet these needs, and safeguard the mental health of red-teamers. We develop our proposed strategies through drawing parallels between common red-teaming practices and interactional labor common to other professions (including actors, mental health professionals, conflict photographers, and content moderators), describing how individuals and organizations within these professional spaces safeguard their mental health given similar psychological demands. Drawing on these protective practices, we describe how safeguards could be adapted for the distinct mental health challenges experienced by red teaming organizations as they mitigate emerging technological risks on the new digital frontlines.

  abstract = {The widespread use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as ChatGPT, has come along with multiple benefits in education (e.g., 24h teacher, augmenting student monitoring). However, at the same time, these tools hinder teachers’ autonomy, limiting the capacity and freedom to exert control over students’ actions and their learning process. Additionally, the generic character of the GenAI output usually lacks contextualization (e.g., course curriculum, students’ age), thus hampering the successful attainment of the course goals. To address these issues, this paper proposes the development of a system mediating between the GenAI interfaces and their back-ends. This system allows teachers to monitor the students’ interactions and align the given answers with the course learning objectives and teaching methods. This research follows the Systems Development Research methodology, and within the first iteration, we developed a system prototype that was evaluated with 8 secondary-school teachers. Results showed a high perceived usefulness of the system for monitoring students’ interactions; for alerting the teachers to take specific actions (e.g., suspicious copy-paste behaviours), and for having control over the GenAI outputs. Additionally, while most teachers perceived a higher autonomy level within the given scenarios, some teachers did not. The evaluation also served to collect further requirements and usability features to keep improving the tool in the next methodological iterations.},

However, granular and real-time data on labor market trends are lacking; publicly available data from survey samples are released with significant lags and miss critical information such as skills and benefits. We use generative Artificial Intelligence to automatically extract structured labor market information from unstructured online job postings for the entire U.S. labor market. To demonstrate our methodology, we construct a sample of 6,800 job postings stratified by 68 major occupational groups, extract structured information on educational requirements, remote-work flexibility, full-time availability, and benefits, and show how these job characteristics vary across occupations. As a validation, we compare frequencies of educational requirements by occupation from our sample to survey data and find no statistically significant difference. Finally, we discuss the scalability to collections of millions of job postings. Our results establish the feasibility of measuring labor market trends at scale from online job postings thanks to advances in generative AI techniques. Improved access to such insights at scale and in real-time could transform the ability of policy leaders, including federal and state agencies and education providers, to make data-informed decisions that better support the American workforce.},

  abstract = {For decades, scholars have emphasized that tasks should be the central focus in Information Retrieval (IR). This point of view holds even more significance with the advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models, which can, among other capabilities, understand natural language, engage in dialog with users, generate bespoke user interfaces, and power agents to help complete tasks. GenAI presents an unprecedented opportunity to finally realize the potential of tasks in IR, enhance task-focused retrieval and interaction, and create ''magical'' task completion moments for users. In this paper, we explore the rationale and methodology behind this argument. Traditional IR systems support mostly simple tasks. The emergence of GenAI creates an opportunity for IR systems to help users achieve complex tasks and for the IR community to rekindle its interest and demonstrate leadership in this sizable and significant problem space. We underscore the pivotal role of tasks in IR and introduce new evidence supporting the notion that task-centric approaches, abstracted from specific modalities, represent the future of IR. Building on this foundation, we envision the development, utilization, and evaluation of next-generation IR systems. We propose a promising future where IR agents prioritize users, their tasks, and their situations. However, despite their potential to address task-focused and modality-independent IR, agents alone are insufficient. We propose a robust ecosystem around these agents that transcends traditional queries, questions, prompts, and modalities to address users' fundamental needs, tasks, and goals.},

Given the widespread use of this tool and the lack of knowledge over how it can support learning, there is a need for educators to have a framework for using it in the classroom and teaching their students usage strategies that are beneficial for learning. One pathway forward is through creativity, a process crucial for learning and also connected to the act of using gen-AI. This poster demonstrates the results of a study designed to provide an in-depth view on how creativity intersects with gen-AI usage in a computational physics course. In the course, students learn about computing tools during group-based, open-ended computational physics activities. Students are often tasked with using gen-AI to explore and help make decisions.

  abstract = {CG (Computer Graphics) is a popular field of CS (Computer Science), but many students find this topic difficult due to it requiring a large number of skills, such as mathematics, programming, geometric reasoning, and creativity. Over the past few years, researchers have investigated ways to harness the power of GenAI (Generative Artificial Intelligence) to improve teaching. In CS, much of the research has focused on introductory computing. A recent study evaluating the performance of an LLM (Large Language Model), GPT-4 (text-only), on CG questions, indicated poor performance and reliance on detailed descriptions of image content, which often required considerable insight from the user to return reasonable results. So far, no studies have investigated the abilities of LMMs (Large Multimodal Models), or multimodal LLMs, to solve CG questions and how these abilities can be used to improve teaching.In this study, we construct two datasets of CG questions requiring varying degrees of visual perception skills and geometric reasoning skills, and evaluate the current state-of-the-art LMM, GPT-4o, on the two datasets. We find that although GPT-4o exhibits great potential in solving questions with visual information independently, major limitations still exist to the accuracy and quality of the generated results. We propose several novel approaches for CG educators to incorporate GenAI into CG teaching despite these limitations. We hope that our guidelines further encourage learning and engagement in CG classrooms.},

These datasets are often built using unrestricted and opaque data collection practices. While most literature focuses on the development and applications of GAI models, the ethical and legal considerations surrounding the creation of these datasets are often neglected. In addition, as datasets are shared, edited, and further reproduced online, information about their origin, legitimacy, and safety often gets lost. To address this gap, we introduce the Compliance Rating Scheme (CRS), a framework designed to evaluate dataset compliance with critical transparency, accountability, and security principles. We also release an open-source Python library built around data provenance technology to implement this framework, allowing for seamless integration into existing dataset-processing and AI training pipelines across multiple data modalities, including images, video, audio, and 3D assets. The library is simultaneously reactive and proactive, as in addition to evaluating the CRS of existing datasets, it equally informs responsible scraping and construction of new datasets.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is a widely popular technology that will have a profound impact on society and individuals. Less than a decade ago, it was thought that creative work would be among the last to be automated&nbsp;– yet today, we see AI encroaching on many creative domains. In this paper, we present the findings of a survey study on people’s perceptions of text-to-image generation. We touch on participants’ technical understanding of the emerging technology, their fears and concerns, and thoughts about risks and dangers of text-to-image generation to the individual and society. We find that while participants were aware of the risks and dangers associated with the technology, only few participants considered the technology to be a personal risk. The risks for others were more easy to recognize for participants. Artists were particularly seen at risk. Interestingly, participants who had tried the technology rated its future importance lower than those who had not tried it. This result shows that many people are still oblivious of the potential personal risks of generative artificial intelligence and the impending societal changes associated with this technology.},

In research, a lot of attention has been given to concerns like academic integrity and how to integrate AI into learning and teaching. However, little is known about how these tools impact student help-seeking patterns and peer interactions. This short paper investigates GenAI tools, help-seeking preferences and the importance of peer support among first-year software engineering students (n=94). Our responses show that 50% of the students use GenAI tools as the primary source of help-seeking, and 43% report that using ChatGPT reduces their need to interact with peers. However, students generally recognize the importance of social interaction and peer support for their learning. We use these duality findings to extend previous recommendations for integrating generative AI in education by providing new recommendations on how educators can support help-seeking and peer support in the age of GenAI.},

  abstract = {As personalized recommendation techniques continue to evolve and be applied, recommendation systems face a plethora of malicious attacks. In order to defend against potential malicious attacks, enhance the robustness of recommendation systems, and strengthen their ability to withstand attacks, it is necessary to propose a method based on Variational Graph Auto-encoders (VGAE) for generating shilling attacks. This method improves the VGAE model, models user profiles, and generates reconstructed user profiles that conform to the original rating patterns. By utilizing spectral clustering, users are selected from the original dataset as templates in a dispersed manner according to a certain attack scale. These templates are then matched with the most similar fake users in the reconstructed user profiles. Within these fake user profiles, ratings for the most popular items in each category and target item ratings are inserted. Finally, fake user profiles are generated and injected into the recommendation system to broadly promote target items to users of the system. Experimental results on the MovieLens 100k and 1M datasets demonstrate that this new method exhibits more stable attack performance and stronger detection evasion capabilities compared to traditional attack strategies, thereby better exposing existing issues within recommendation systems.},

However, traditional approaches could be underperforming as they often use data-driven strategies and assume that people only need additional information about their consumption to change behavior. A proposed path to overcome this issue is to design eco-feedback to foster emotional connections with users. However, not much is known about the effectiveness of such designs. In this paper, we propose a novel care-based eco-feedback system. Central to the system is a Tamagotchi-inspired digital character named Infi who gets its life force from the user’s energy savings. Additionally, we harness the latest advancements in generative artificial intelligence to enhance emotional attachment through conversational interactions that users can have with Infi. The results of a randomized controlled experiment (N=420) convey the fact that this design increases emotional attachment, which in turn increases energy-saving behavior.},

Our work builds on this scholarship by investigating how neurodivergent individuals use Large Language Model-based chatbots in real-life settings. We conducted interviews with 15 neurodivergent participants to understand their expansive use of these chatbots, which we present as use case categories. We then designed diary studies to capture prompting strategies participants employ within these use cases while conversing with the Large Language Model-based chatbot Gemini. Based on early analysis of our conversational dataset, we showcase specific prompting queries from participants, highlight participant strategies to refine Gemini’s responses, and identify Gemini’s strengths and weaknesses during interaction.},

However, with the complexity of terms in the electric power field, the generic word-based encoding approach of natural language understanding model fails to identify those domain phrases even if they appear in the training samples. To improve the semantic accuracy of special content labeling, this paper proposes a words-phrase fusion encoding NLU model with the help of domain corpus. We pre-train a phrase-level Bert model in the electric power field which is involved during the model encoding step to accurately capture the semantics of domain terms and perceive the boundary of phrases. Additionally, continuous consistency loss of sequences is added to the model to reduce the to reduce the misclassification of individual words in the phrases. Experiment with real dataset in power QA system demonstrates that our model helps improve semantic parsing accuracy on both training and untrained items, alleviates the complete dependency of the phrase encoding model on word segmentation results.},

Our goal is to not only showcase the potential of GenAI for design, but to engage in discussions of its shortcomings and opportunities as they have been already articulated by scholars. By synthesizing both published and unpublished works, we will develop best practices, ethical considerations, and future research directions for the use of GenAI in design. We will explore a range of topics and themes, including leveraging the characteristics of GenAI for design, mapping the diverse applications of GenAI in design, envisioning a framework for design, and guiding future work on GenAI in design research. Ultimately, we hope to provide a roadmap for the integration of GenAI into the design research process and to encourage designers and researchers to explore the potential of GenAI in a thoughtful and deliberate way.},

In a pilot study with 37 fifth-graders, we explored how children (ages 9–10) envision genAI and the roles they believe it should play in their daily life. Our findings reveal three key ways children envision genAI: as a companion providing guidance, a collaborator working alongside them, and a task automator that offloads responsibilities. However, alongside these hopeful views, children expressed fears about overreliance, particularly in academic settings, linking it to fears of diminished learning, disciplinary consequences, and long-term failure. This study highlights the need for child-centric AI design that balances these tensions, empowering children with the skills to critically engage with and navigate their evolving relationships with digital technologies.},

  abstract = {Multimodal generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers new affordances for inclusive education, particularly for children with vision impairments (CVIs), by enabling alternate representations that align with non-visual mental models. While GenAI tools are rapidly reshaping mainstream educational practices worldwide, their design and deployment often presume a digitally literate, sighted teaching workforce and well-resourced institutional contexts. In this paper, we address a critical gap in HCI and accessibility research: the near-total absence of empirical studies on teachers with vision impairments (TVIs), who play a central pedagogical role in schools for the blind across the Global South. Through in-depth interviews with 15 TVIs in Karnataka and a nationwide survey of 105 TVIs across 15 Indian states, we surface the everyday teaching practices, technological aspirations, and systemic constraints that shape their engagement with digital technologies, including GenAI. Our findings reveal a disjuncture between the potential of GenAI and the readiness of the institutional and infrastructural ecosystem in which TVIs operate. We document pervasive challenges, including limited access to devices and connectivity, insufficient training, resistance from school management, and entrenched barriers to STEM education, while also highlighting sites of resilience, innovation, and professional commitment. This study advances the HCI discourse by centering disabled educators as key agents in the design of accessible educational futures. We argue that realizing GenAI’s inclusive potential requires moving beyond assistive technology retrofits toward co-designed, contextually grounded systems that respond to the lived realities of TVIs in the Global South.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the integration of deep learning technology with Side-Channel Analysis (SCA) methods to effectively analyze the Curve-25519 algorithm implemented on an MCU chip. The Curve-25519 algorithm, protected by the security features of elliptical curve algorithms and constant-time operations, presents a challenge for low-cost, non-invasive SCA methods due to its robustness. This work focuses on the leakage of conditional judgment operations that occur before each point addition and point doubling operation. By identifying these information leakage points through SCA, electromagnetic radiation and power consumption information are collected and labeled. We conduct a dataset and transformed 1-dimensional signals into a 2D image for training. The trained model is subsequently used for testing. Experiments demonstrate that this method can effectively analyze leakage points in the Curve-25519 algorithm and help to improve the robustness of the algorithm.},

  abstract = {Medical institutions are looking forward to importing innovative information services to reduce the burden on medical staff. For example, medical staff repeatedly process the contextual data in each stage of the prenatal examinations, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. If a dispute happens, the data will become the evidence to support whether the prenatal examinations were handled appropriately. Therefore, if the prenatal examination data is not accurately recorded and properly preserved, it will become a source of pressure for medical staff to face disputes in the future. This research takes the prenatal examinations of pregnant as a use case. We apply robotic process automation technology to assist in the automation of prenatal examinations and blockchain technology to establish trustworthy prenatal examinations. Besides, we also use generative artificial intelligence technology to provide intelligent user-assisted consultation in open-domain question answering. The contribution of this work is to build an automated reliable prenatal examination information service to provide good care for pregnant.},

The paramount challenge faced by video streaming service providers is ensuring high Quality of Experience (QoE) for users. In HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS), including DASH and HLS, video content is encoded at multiple quality versions, with an Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) algorithm dynamically selecting versions based on network conditions. Concurrently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the industry, particularly in content recommendation and personalization. Leveraging user data and advanced algorithms, AI enhances user engagement, satisfaction, and video quality through super-resolution and denoising techniques.However, challenges persist, such as real-time processing on resource-constrained devices, the need for diverse training datasets, privacy concerns, and model interpretability. Despite these hurdles, the promise of Generative Artificial Intelligence emerges as a transformative force. Generative AI, capable of synthesizing new data based on learned patterns, holds vast potential in the video streaming landscape. In the context of video streaming, it can create realistic and immersive content, adapt in real time to individual preferences, and optimize video compression for seamless streaming in low-bandwidth conditions.This research proposal outlines a comprehensive exploration at the intersection of advanced AI algorithms and digital entertainment, focusing on the potential of generative AI to elevate video quality, user interactivity, and the overall streaming experience. The objective is to integrate generative models into video streaming pipelines, unraveling novel avenues that promise a future of dynamic, personalized, and visually captivating streaming experiences for viewers.},

While these systems often generate convincing and coherent responses, they risk producing incorrect or non-factual information, known as confabulations or hallucinations. Consequently, users must critically assess the reliability of these outputs when interacting with LLM-based agents. Although advancements such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have improved the technical performance of these systems, there is a lack of empirical models that explain how humans detect confabulations. Building on the explainable AI (XAI) literature, we examine the role of reasoning-based explanations in helping users identify confabulations in LLM systems. An online experiment (n = 97) reveals that analogical and factual explanations improve detection accuracy but require more time and cognitive effort than the no explanation baseline.},

  abstract = {The traditional evaluation of information retrieval (IR) systems is generally very costly as it requires manual relevance annotation from human experts. Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence -specifically large language models (LLMs)- can generate relevance annotations at an enormous scale with relatively small computational costs. Potentially, this could alleviate the costs traditionally associated with IR evaluation and make it applicable to numerous low-resource applications. However, generated relevance annotations are not immune to (systematic) errors, and as a result, directly using them for evaluation produces unreliable results.In this work, we propose two methods based on prediction-powered inference and conformal risk control that utilize computer-generated relevance annotations to place reliable confidence intervals (CIs) around IR evaluation metrics. Our proposed methods require a small number of reliable annotations from which the methods can statistically analyze the errors in the generated annotations. Using this information, we can place CIs around evaluation metrics with strong theoretical guarantees. Unlike existing approaches, our conformal risk control method is specifically designed for ranking metrics and can vary its CIs per query and document. Our experimental results show that our CIs accurately capture both the variance and bias in evaluation based on LLM annotations, better than the typical empirical bootstrapping estimates. We hope our contributions bring reliable evaluation to the many IR applications where this was traditionally infeasible.},

Through 12 post-class group interviews, we identified how GenAI co-design behaviors present both benefits—such as enhanced creativity and faster design iterations—and risks, including shallow learning and reflection. Benefits were most evident during the execution phases, while the discovery and reflection phases showed limited gains. A taxonomy of usage patterns revealed that students’ outcomes depended more on how they used GenAI than the specific tasks performed. These findings highlight the need for HCI education to adapt to GenAI’s role and offer recommendations for curricula to better prepare future designers for effective creative co-design.},

The key contribution of this work is not in the idea of using LLMs for debugging itself (which has already been demonstrated elsewhere, e.g., [3]) but to demonstrate the ease, flexibility, and pedagogical potential of the strategy. In particular, through carefully crafted prompts and easily accessible platforms, rubber duck LLMs can assist learners with specific questions while also situating those questions alongside larger computer science concepts and computational thinking practices.

However, this integration raises critical concerns about trust and ethics, which are crucial in shaping both the acceptance and effective utilisation of these technologies. There are many reports, articles and papers currently exploring the opportunities and challenges of LLMs in higher education from the perspective of students and educators. However, these papers often focus on specific contexts like in the UK, US or a particular institutions.

Some findings of this work are: (1) Students and educators found different ways to use generative AI. Students focus more on using it as an assistant (revising and preparing for lectures, helping with homework) and educators as a content production assistant (writing lecture notes, personalising content). Commonalities are that both students and educators use generative AI as an accessibility aid, e.g., to rephrase sentences or explain concepts. (2) The main concerns of higher education regarding generative AI are equity in access, clarity of rules regarding usage, and job displacement.},

  abstract = {What if everyday technologies were designed for productivity and learning? This is critical in the era of generative artificial intelligence and pervasive digital technologies, where technology design substantially shapes what and how humans are learning. This paper introduces “support for learning” as an explicit design goal for everyday technologies. To provide background, we first differentiate four relationships between learning and technology: (1) learning to use technology, (2) learning about technology, (3) learning as a primary design goal, and (4) learning through technology. Designers can intentionally facilitate the latter (a) by following established design principles for usability and user experience, but need to go beyond such known ground by (b) identifying potential learning goals, and (c) connecting to high-quality learning resources and technology designed from within the system. A future research agenda should investigate the relationships between patterns of technology design, patterns of technology use, and learning.},

  abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) has revolutionized software engineering (SE) by automating tasks across design, coding, and testing [1] [2]. Tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot streamline code generation, architectural modeling, debugging, and test-case creation [3] [4]. Despite their rapid adoption in industry, the pedagogical implications of these tools in computing education have not been systematically examined. This study solves the existing gap by conducting a comprehensive benchmarking study of Gen-AI tools across four core SE phases— design documentation, feature implementation, debugging support, and testing — to address two research questions:RQ1: What strengths and limitations do Gen-AI tools exhibit in each phase?RQ2: How can insights from benchmarking inform effective integration of Gen-AI into SE curricula?To answer these questions, a diverse set of Gen-AI tools is evaluated, ranging from design-focused assistants such as Lucidchart, Mermaid.js and UIzard; implementation-oriented systems including GitHub Copilot, TabNine, Codeium and Supermaven; debugging supports like GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet; and testing frameworks such as Testim, Mabl and Applitools—while also surveying emerging platforms (as of summer 2024) like Replit, Postman, Visily, Gemini, Eraser.io and others. For each tool and development phase, we applied phase-specific metrics: in design documentation, we assessed diagram accuracy, completeness, user effort, and IDE integration; in feature implementation, we measured pattern-based code generation quality, code-completion effectiveness, refactoring robustness, and UI/UX scaffolding; in debugging, we evaluated error-detection accuracy, hallucination rates, and clarity of explanatory feedback; and in testing, we examined test-case relevance and defect-detection coverage. Across all phases, we tracked prompt engineering complexity as a key mediating factor influencing tool performance.Our evaluation reveals speed-fidelity trade-offs: Code-completion assistants accelerate boilerplate generation but demand manual oversight to ensure cross-file consistency and manage higher-order abstractions; diagramming tools can produce precise UML models with minimal effort— but at the cost of iterative prompt refinement for complex cases; LLM debuggers deliver context-sensitive fixes yet suffer from nontrivial hallucination rates; testing generators exhibit wide variance in edge-case coverage. On average, tools needed 2.4 prompt iterations for usable diagrams and 1.5 prompts for bug fixes, underscoring the human effort in guiding AI.We recommend a scaffolded framework for integrating Gen-AI into SE education by: embedding AI tools into hands-on assignments, to explore tasks in a controlled context; by structuring small team projects in which one subgroup uses AI assistants while the other completes the same tasks manually (covering design, implementation, debugging and testing) to surface contrasts in workflow, tool strengths, and human reasoning; by requiring students to maintain a reflective journal documenting their AI usage and prompt-engineering strategies, fostering metacognitive insight into how tool inputs shape outputs; and by equipping learners with decision making criteria, teaching them to evaluate AI assistants according to task fit- preparing them to leverage AI responsibly across SE phases in its evolving landscape.},

The permanence of fingerprints means security breaches can have lasting impacts. Traditionally, organizations store only fingerprint templates to mitigate the risks associated with stolen fingerprint images. However, advances in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), particularly deepfake technologies, now enable adversaries to generate fingerprints from stolen templates, increasing the threat of data breaches.In this paper, we demonstrate and validate a previously theorized threat by evaluating an end-to-end attack in the physical world. Our approach involves: (1) generating fingerprint images from unseen templates, (2) fabricating silicone replicas of these deepfake fingerprints using a 3D resin printer, and (3) successfully deceiving fingerprint scanners with the replicas. The entire lab setup cost only $440 USD and only 7 cents to replicate each fingerprint thereafter, highlighting the attack's practicality.To support reproducibility and encourage the development of defenses, we publicly release our deepfake fingerprint pipeline.},

  abstract = {Prompt and sufficient feedback is essential for students' academic learning since it enables them to review their learning techniques and improve their areas of weakness. Nevertheless, delivering personalised feedback to every student continues to be difficult&nbsp;for teachers due to its demanding and time-intensive nature. While automated feedback systems are available, their primary focus is providing feedback on a single subject, and most of them utilise statistical analysis or traditional machine learning techniques to provide feedback. Moreover, no feedback model utilises the same criteria to generate text-based feedback for more than one subject. Generative artificial intelligence (GEN AI) has recently made incredible progress, and large language models (LLMs) can retain the context from the vast amount of text. Hence, this research presents a framework that employs an innovative technique to offer text-based feedback to students in different fields of study. This framework employs two LLMs, one for generating the feedback and another for categorising it into separate subjects using suitable headings for structural organising. Consequently, the output produced by this technology corresponds to the original tone of the teacher.},

To allow for the development and testing of new algorithms adapted to this new data landscape, test problems are necessary as a way to both evaluate and compare algorithms performances. However, while recent advances extended known test problems such as the r-Leading-Ones marking the transition from binary to multi-valued variables, having different data-types coexisting in the search space is still an open question.

Its design with dependency between the different data-types and its continuity with the r-Leading-Ones provides a convenient new environment for benchmark and runtime analysis for mixed-category search spaces.},

  abstract = {In an era where digital technology is reshaping human-computer interaction, this research investigates the constraints associated with users assuming passive roles in conventional characters. To address this issue, a "User-Involved Real-Time Interactive System for Digital Humans" has been developed. The system integrates multimodal data acquisition devices—such as thermal sensors, visual cameras, and heart rate trackers—with advanced generative artificial intelligence models. By processing user-specific physiological characteristics and behavioral tendencies, the system dynamically generates personalized virtual entities. This approach empowers individuals from mere recipients of digital content to active participants in its creation. Furthermore, leveraging the TouchDesigner platform, the system constructs mixed-reality settings. Through the integration of sensor-based hardware and ComfyUI processing pipelines, it ensures immediate synchronization between users' real-time inputs and the generation of corresponding virtual characters. Experimental results demonstrate that the system enhances user immersion, engagement, and emotional satisfaction through visual editing, driving the evolution from static identity models to real-time dynamic systems and offering novel pathways for technological value conversion.},

  abstract = {The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has ignited discussions surrounding its potential to enhance creative pursuits. However, distinctions between children’s and adult’s creative needs exist, which is important when considering the possibility of GenAI for children’s creative usage. Building upon work in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), fostering children’s computational thinking skills, this study explores interactions between children (aged 7-13) and GenAI tools through methods of participatory design. We seek to answer two questions: (1) How do children in co-design workshops perceive GenAI tools and their usage for creative works? and (2) How do children navigate the creative process while using GenAI tools? How might these interactions support their confidence in their ability to create? Our findings contribute a model that describes the potential contexts underpinning child-GenAI creative interactions and explores implications of this model for theories of creativity, design, and use of GenAI as a constructionist tool for creative self-efficacy.},

This paper presents an automated radiology report generation framework that combines Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) with a Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to bridge AI performance with clinical explainability. CBMs map chest X-ray features to human-understandable clinical concepts, enabling transparent disease classification. Meanwhile, the RAG system integrates multi-agent collaboration and external knowledge to produce contextually rich, evidence-based reports. Our demonstration showcases the system’s ability to deliver interpretable predictions, mitigate hallucinations, and generate high-quality, tailored reports with an interactive interface addressing accuracy, trust, and usability challenges. This framework provides a pathway to improving diagnostic consistency and empowering radiologists with actionable insights.},

  abstract = {In creator economy, the online platform posts contract to incentivize creators for high-quality content. The creators can use human effort or Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) to assist them to create content for rewards. In this work, we identify that the existing contract suffers from GenAI-Induced Effort Degradation, where creators may not try their best to create high-quality content, but instead turn to GenAI to save effort and extract additional reward. Our results show that GenAI-induced effort degradation arises from failing to provide the same profit for the creators generating the same quality content. With this observation, we design the contract for creator economy in the era of GenAI as a classical contract for human content and a reward for the GenAI content which depends on the estimation of the human effort cost required to achieve GenAI's content quality. To overcome the curse of dimensionality in learning the optimal contract that maximizes platform profit with a high-quality content guarantee, we design an adaptive action pruning method that gradually filters out contracts resulting in low quality. Simulation experiments on synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

Meanwhile, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has the potential to transform user experiences through personalization and adaptive interactions. The integration of these technologies offers a novel opportunity to refine GenAI models by leveraging human gaze data in adaptive interfaces, personalized content generation, and human-computer interaction. However, gaze data is highly sensitive and can reveal several user attributes, such as cognitive states, emotions, and even medical conditions. Therefore, the use of gaze data to inform GenAI models raises significant privacy concerns. Hence, in this paper, we highlight the implications of using eye gaze information in GenAI models with privacy and societal considerations and discuss strategies to mitigate potential privacy violations. By addressing these issues, we can ensure a trade-off between technological advancements and privacy protection.},

The primary objective of this integration is to augment the credibility and diversity of generative AI in music synthesis, fostering computational artistic creativity in humans. Furthermore, a user-friendly interactive music player has been designed to facilitate users in the music synthesis process. The proposed method exemplifies a paradigm wherein users manipulate latent space through human-machine interaction, underscoring the pivotal role of humans in the synthesis of diverse and creative music.},

Through a large-scale experiment involving more than 800 students (aged 10–12) in Shenzhen (China), we assessed quantitative and qualitative data embedded in emotional alignment, creative engagement, and platform suitability. Our findings show that EAPF substantially improves the emotional expressiveness of AI-generated works of art, while offering data-based insights for educators to tailor art teaching to individual student preferences. Thus, this study demonstrates the potential of well-designed prompt engineering to overcome accessibility barriers in traditional art education while enhancing emotional development.

This study explores the behavioral characteristics and text generation quality of college students when using generative AI tools, and proposes an integrated research framework that combines natural language processing (NLP), cluster analysis, and regression models. This study uses 200 students from a university in Guangdong as the research dataset, uses the BERT model to quantify the fluency, relevance, and creativity of generated texts, and uses the K-means algorithm to classify students' behaviors into three categories: high-frequency learners, low-frequency casual users, and mixed users. The experimental results show that the text quality under different task types is significantly different. For example, the scenarios of writing summary generation and creative writing are different. The summary generation task has the highest score in relevance (90 points), while the creative writing task performs well in creativity (85 points). Subsequent regression analysis found that professional background and technical attitude are key factors affecting behavioral patterns. Students of science and engineering tend to frequently use generative AI tools for complex tasks, while students of humanities pay more attention to language fluency and creativity.},

We present findings from group interviews and a survey study conducted with interaction design bachelor students, foregrounding the attitudes and perspectives of students who are motivated to learn. We show that although students are generally aware of ethical issues surrounding GenAI, they make considered decisions on how they use it to support their learning. An insight is how the students’ pride in their own learning and accomplishment guides their use more than moralistic and disciplinary rhetoric widespread in the higher education sector. The paper concludes with thought-provoking questions to guide future steps.

  abstract = {Museum field trips provide a rich learning experience for children. However, they are complex and expensive for teachers to organize. Fortunately, digitization of museum artifacts makes it possible to use museum resources within the classroom. Museum in the Classroom (MITC) explores how augmented reality (AR) and generative artificial intelligence (AI) can create an interactive learning experience around museum artifacts. This iPad app allows educators to select historical topics from a curated artifact library, generating AR-based exhibits that students can explore. MITC engages students through interactive AR artifacts, AI-driven chatbots, and AI-generated quiz questions, based on a real exhibition at the Cantor Arts Center at Stanford University. A formative study with middle schoolers (N = 20) demonstrated that the app increased engagement compared to traditional learning methods. MITC also fostered a playful and comfortable environment to interact with museum artifacts. Our findings suggest that combining AR and AI has the potential to enrich classroom learning and offer a scalable alternative to traditional museum visits.},

Yet, we have limited understanding of how blind people use and make sense of GenAI systems. To bridge this gap, we report findings from interviews with 19 blind individuals who incorporate mainstream GenAI tools like ChatGPT and Be My AI in their everyday practices. Our findings reveal how blind users navigate accessibility issues, inaccuracies, hallucinations, and idiosyncracies associated with GenAI and develop interesting (but often flawed) mental models of how these tools work. We discuss key considerations for rethinking access and information verification in GenAI tools, unpacking erroneous mental models among blind users, and reconciling harms and benefits of GenAI from an accessibility perspective.},

However, the task quality along with the student perspective on such generated tasks remains largely unexplored. Therefore, this paper introduces and evaluates a new feature of the so-called Tutor Kai for generating comprehensive programming tasks, including problem descriptions, code skeletons, unit tests, and model solutions. The presented system allows students to freely choose programming concepts and contextual themes for their tasks. To evaluate the system, we conducted a two-phase mixed-methods study comprising (1) an expert rating of 200 automatically generated programming tasks w.r.t. task quality, and (2) a study with 26 computer science students who solved and rated the personalized programming tasks. Results show that experts classified 89.5% of the generated tasks as functional and 92.5% as solvable. However, the system's rate for implementing all requested programming concepts decreased from 94% for single-concept tasks to 40% for tasks addressing three concepts. The student evaluation further revealed high satisfaction with the personalization. Students also reported perceived benefits for learning. The results imply that the new feature has the potential to offer students individual tasks aligned with their context and need for exercise. Tool developers, educators, and, above all, students can benefit from these insights and the system itself.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence is widely used for various tasks such as language translation and art creation. Generative inference employs the key and value tensors to encode relational information among the tokens in the input and output sequences. Most of the existing generative inference frameworks use KV caching (KVC), which caches the key and value tensors (i.e., the KV cache) to avoid recomputing the key and value tensors for each of the processed tokens. Despite the widespread use of KVC, in-depth characterization of KVC with tensor offloading, which enables generative inference with a single GPU, remains yet to be explored. To bridge this gap, this work presents an in-depth characterization study of KVC, which demonstrates that KVC makes a sub-optimal trade-off between computations and communications in the context of generative inference with tensor offloading. Guided by the characterization results, we propose a novel caching technique called activation sequence caching (ASC) for high-throughput and memory-efficient generative inference with a single GPU. ASC is designed to significantly reduce the memory usage and communication overheads of generative inference at the cost of the increased computational complexity. We provide an analytical analysis of the three caching techniques (i.e., zero caching, KVC, and ASC) for generative inference in terms of the memory usage, communication overheads, and computational complexity. Our quantitative evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of ASC in that ASC significantly (e.g., 78.3% higher throughput) outperforms a state-of-the-art generative inference framework (i.e., FlexGen) that implements KVC across various model sizes, input and output sequence lengths, and GPUs.},

The study evaluates GenAI effectiveness in teaching a new programming concept and examines its perceived utility from the students' perspective. A conversational AI platform, powered by ChatGPT, was developed as a pilot, and used as a virtual tutor, guiding students through an interactive, time-constrained learning session that involved two steps: teaching the new topic followed by problem-solving activities. After the session, students wrote a quiz without assistance to evaluate their newly acquired knowledge. A survey was then administered to collect student perceptions and analyze their interactions with the AI tutor. The preliminary findings suggest that GenAI tutors can effectively support learning, with most students preferring AI over human tutors due to convenience, accessibility, and stress-free environment. While variability of prompt effectiveness and students' misuse or overreliance on AI highlight areas were observed, these results highlight avenues for future research to refine GenAI strategies and improve student learning.},

We used Gherkin, a domain-specific language that allows non-technical practitioners to define test scenarios using a human-readable syntax. Our findings indicate that using ChatGPT significantly reduces the time required to develop automated test scripts without compromising the reliability of the scripts. Statistical analysis shows a notable reduction in development time for the ChatGPT-assisted group compared to the manual group, with a large effect size. While the reliability of the tests did not show a significant difference between the two groups, the results suggest practical benefits in terms of efficiency.},

Currently, most institutions adapt their policies reactively as challenges arise, often without adopting a systematic framework, with minimal guidance and limited knowledge of the approaches taken by other institutions across the United States (U.S.). This study aims to bridge this gap by identifying core themes surrounding AI policies and guidelines across the top 50 U.S. universities. Given the labor- and time-intensive nature required to manually synthesize multiple policy documents across many institutions, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to identify common and prevalent themes. Our framework first summarizes AI policies at the institutional level, followed by the generation of multiple sets of themes through an iterative process of prompt chaining and self-refinement. Finally, the common themes from these distinct sets were consolidated. This framework is designed to address potential flaws in pre-trained LLMs, such as hallucinations. Seven distinct themes are uncovered: (1) academic integrity and responsible AI use, (2) communication of AI policies, (3) data privacy and security concerns, (4) ethical considerations in AI use, (5) continuous adaptation and policy evolution, (6) documentation and transparency in AI usage, and (7) instructor discretion in AI integration. Our work lays the foundation for future analyses or recommendations in developing comprehensive and equitable AI policies.

In this paper, we investigate the potential of collaborative GenAI agents to augment teamwork in synchronous group settings through an exploratory study that engaged 25 professionals across 6 teams in speculative design workshops and individual follow-up interviews. Our workshops included a mixed reality provotype to simulate embodied collaborative GenAI agents capable of actively participating in group discussions. Our findings suggest that, if designed well, collaborative GenAI agents offer valuable opportunities to enhance team problem-solving by challenging groupthink, bridging communication gaps, and reducing social friction. However, teams' willingness to integrate GenAI agents depended on its perceived fit across a number of individual, team, and organizational factors.

A thorough analysis of these policies on a global scale is important for guiding educational innovation and ensuring the effectiveness of technology applications. This article uses a content analysis method, taking 26 artificial intelligence education policies from major countries and international organizations as samples, and employs a "policy tool—policy content" two-dimensional analysis framework to quantitatively analyze the policy texts to reveal the characteristics of international artificial intelligence education policies. The study finds that the current types of policy tools are mainly supply-oriented and environmental-oriented, focusing more on dimensions such as quality assessment and assurance, resource environment construction, and future talent cultivation in terms of content elements. Supply-side tools provide resource support for the construction of intelligent educational environments and innovative cultivation services for the improvement of teachers' and students' intelligent literacy; environmental tools build institutional standards for the quality assurance of intelligent education and create organizational strategies to achieve inclusive and fair education. Finally, the study proposes suggestions for the formulation and optimization of artificial intelligence education policies from four aspects: strengthening talent cultivation, focusing on independent research and development, deepening international exchanges, and systematic policy design, to promote the high-quality development of teaching and education in the digital age.},

Text-to-image generation technology has become increasingly prevalent in advertising content production, demonstrating promising performance improvements in terms of semantic relevance and visual appeal. However, existing models often suffer from inadequate representation of entity concepts, such as prominent product brands and recognizable landmarks. This inherent limitation subsequently leads to notable deficiencies in brand tonality, industry-specific relevance, and market adaptability of the generated advertising content. To address this challenge, we propose a multimodal ad content generation framework specifically engineered for online advertising system, particularly focused on resolving the deficiency in entity concepts. Our framework is comprised of two phases: first, an image captioning module with entity-aware learning based on multimodal large language model, leveraging retrieval-augmented techniques to incorporate entity concepts into image descriptions; second, a text-to-image diffusion model refined on image-text pairs enriched with entity concepts to facilitate entity-grounded image generation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior performance in both image captioning and image generation compared to existing methods, particularly in the accuracy of depiction of relevant entities in advertising images. Moreover, the deployment of the framework in the system primary traffic of Baidu Search Ads, has brought significant enhancements to advertisement revenue for both advertisers and the platform.},

  abstract = {Search and recommender systems should prioritize support for user tasks over support for individual queries or actions. To that end, the Information Retrieval (IR) community has spent decades trying to understand users' tasks and their contexts, and how to best assist users in making progress toward completing them. The recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have drastically shifted the landscape of task-focused IR. Users can now express not only their queries and questions, but actual information needs, tasks, and goals in natural language to an AI system and receive not just results, but also answers in natural language that are generated specifically for them. This new paradigm raises many interesting questions, opportunities, and challenges. We brought together a group of highly motivated students and scholars in a two-day workshop on the Microsoft campus in Redmond to discuss these issues, learn from each other, and envision a new future for task-focused IR and information access more broadly.Date: 28--29 September 2023.Website: https://ir-ai.github.io.},

However, existing works focused on conventional machine-learning and pattern-based AI systems, and little is known about how researchers interact with GenAI in qualitative research. This work delves into researchers’ perceptions of their collaboration with GenAI, specifically ChatGPT. Through a user study involving ten qualitative researchers, we found ChatGPT to be a valuable collaborator for thematic analysis, enhancing coding efficiency, aiding initial data exploration, offering granular quantitative insights, and assisting comprehension for non-native speakers and non-experts. Yet, concerns about its trustworthiness and accuracy, reliability and consistency, limited contextual understanding, and broader acceptance within the research community persist. We contribute five actionable design recommendations to foster effective human-AI collaboration. These include incorporating transparent explanatory mechanisms, enhancing interface and integration capabilities, prioritising contextual understanding and customisation, embedding human-AI feedback loops and iterative functionality, and strengthening trust through validation mechanisms.},

However, text-to-image generation—where images are produced from typed prompts—can be less engaging in public settings since the act of typing tends to limit interactive audience participation, thereby reducing its suitability for designing dynamic public installations. In this article, we explore body prompting as input modality for image generation in the context of public event settings. Body prompting extends interaction with generative AI beyond textual inputs to reconnect the creative act of image generation with the physical act of creating artworks. We implement this concept in an interactive art installation, Artworks Reimagined, designed to transform existing artworks via body prompting. We deployed the installation at an event with hundreds of visitors in a public and private setting. Our semi-structured interviews with a sample of visitors (N = 79) show that body prompting was well-received and provides an engaging and fun experience. We present insights into participants’ experience of body prompting and AI co-creation and identify three distinct strategies of embodied interaction focused on re-creating, reimagining, or casual interaction. We provide valuable recommendations for practitioners seeking to design interactive generative AI experiences in museums, galleries, and public event spaces.},

We evaluate multiple GenAI models across tasks that involve the rating of, and reasoning about, the credibility of information. The information in our experiments comes from content that subnational U.S. politicians post to Facebook. We find that GPT-4o, one of the most used AI models in consumer applications, outperforms other models, but all models exhibit only moderate agreement with human coders. Importantly, even when GenAI models accurately identify low-credibility content, their reasoning relies heavily on linguistic features and “hard” criteria, such as the level of detail, source reliability and language formality, rather than an understanding of veracity. We also assess the effectiveness of summarized versus full content inputs, finding that summarized content holds promise for improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. While GenAI has the potential to support human fact-checkers in scaling misinformation detection, our results caution against relying solely on these models.},

To address this limitation, in this work, we explore the integration of generative artificial intelligence techniques with physics-based simulators to enhance ADS system-level testing. Our study evaluates the effectiveness and computational overhead of three generative strategies based on diffusion models, namely instruction-editing, inpainting, and inpainting with refinement. Specifically, we assess these techniques' capabilities to produce augmented simulator-generated images of driving scenarios representing new ODDs. We employ a novel automated detector for invalid inputs based on semantic segmentation to ensure semantic preservation and realism of the neural generated images. We then performed system-level testing to evaluate the ability of the ADS to generalize to newly synthesized ODDs. Our findings show that diffusion models help to increase the coverage of ODD for system-level ADS testing. Our automated semantic validator achieved a percentage of false positives as low as 3%, retaining the correctness and quality of the images generated for testing. Our approach successfully identified new ADS system failures before real-world testing.},

While the currently discussed European AI Act aims at addressing these risks through Article 52’s AI transparency obligations, its interpretation and implications remain unclear. In this early work, we adopt a participatory AI approach to derive key questions based on Article 52’s disclosure obligations. We ran two workshops with researchers, designers, and engineers across disciplines (N=16), where participants deconstructed Article 52’s relevant clauses using the 5W1H framework. We contribute a set of 149 questions clustered into five themes and 18 sub-themes. We believe these can not only help inform future legal developments and interpretations of Article 52, but also provide a starting point for Human-Computer Interaction research to (re-)examine disclosure transparency from a human-centered AI lens.},

This conjecture aligns with the development of AI-driven conversational agents, aiming to utilise advance natural language processing (NLP) methods to enhance the capabilities of voice assistants. However, design guidelines for VAs prioritise maximum efficiency by advocating for the use of concise answers. This poses a conflict with the challenges around generative AI, such as inaccuracies and misinterpretation, as shorter responses may not adequately provide users with meaningful information. AI-VA systems can adapt drivers of trust formation, such as references and authorship, to improve credibility. A better understanding of user behaviour when using the system is needed to develop revised design recommendations for AI-powered VA systems. This paper reports an online survey of 256 participants residing in the U.K. and nine follow-up interviews, where user behaviour is investigated to identify drivers of trust in the context of obtaining digital information from a generative AI-based VA system. Adding references is promising as a tool for increasing trust in systems producing text, yet we found no evidence that the inclusion of references in a VA response contributed towards the perceived reliability or trust towards the system. We examine further variables driving user trust in AI-powered VA systems.},

  abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has significantly increased the sophistication and ease of image tampering techniques, posing challenges for digital forensics in identifying manipulated images. A lack of dataset standardisation hinders the ability to effectively benchmark and compare GenAI inpainting localisation techniques, reducing their reliability in digital forensic applications. This paper aims to address this gap by exploring the need for standardised criteria for datasets in digital forensics for benchmarking detection techniques through preliminary experiments.To address the limited diversity in existing datasets, a small-scale dataset was developed, consisting of 240 tampered images, 20 masks and 20 authentic images. This dataset includes four subject image classes (animals, objects, persons, scenery) and three inpainting tools (GLIDE, GalaxyAI, Photoshop). The dataset was evaluated against 13 localisation algorithms from the Image Forensics MATLAB Toolbox to determine key components that should be considered in the standardisation of testing environments.The results show that the images in the animals and persons categories achieved the highest F1-Scores and accuracy over the other classes. Among tools, GLIDE inpainted images were consistently shown to be the most challenging to detect, underscoring the importance of further investigating these images. These findings provide foundational insights for identifying a set of criteria to establish robust testing environments, enabling the development of reliable and accurate GenAI inpainting localisation techniques.},

  abstract = {This study explores the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), in particular, ChatGPT, on the public sector workforce in the United States, focusing on task replacement, assistance potential, and the evolving landscape of skills. Utilizing GPT-4 to evaluate 1,022 core tasks across 51 public sector occupations, we provide an exploratory analysis of the roles susceptible to ChatGPT automation and those in which ChatGPT can augment human efforts. Our findings reveal that while 63% of tasks are resistant to ChatGPT replacement, primarily due to their requirement for physical presence, emotional intelligence, and complex decision-making, tasks that are routine, rule-based, and involving basic content generation show a high potential for automation. The study also identifies key skills that will remain vital, those likely to become obsolete, and new skills that will emerge as essential, highlighting the need for a strategic approach to workforce development in the face of AI advancements. In particular, our findings underscore the growing importance of skills in applying AI technologies and the ability to validate and interpret AI-generated content for humans to remain competitive. We offer insights into public-sector-specific impacts and propose a methodological framework for future research, emphasizing the importance of adapting educational curricula and policies to prepare for an AI-integrated future.},

It has been praised for its ability to generate human-like responses but has perhaps faced even more criticism over potential concerns for biased responses, misinformation, and generation of harmful or inappropriate content. Chat GPT utilizes large sources of data to curate responses to all kinds of questions. The generative AI models are designed to be objective and avoid any sort of bias in their output. However, in the age of misinformation, social media, user-generated content and the 24-hour news cycle, biased information has never been more plentiful.

  abstract = {Investigation of students’ perceptions and opinions on the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in education is a topic gaining much interest. Studies addressing this are typically conducted with large heterogeneous groups, at one moment in time. However, how students perceive and use GenAI tools can potentially depend on many factors, including their background knowledge, familiarity with the tools, and the learning goals and policies of the courses they are taking. In this study we explore how students following computing courses use GenAI for programming-related tasks across different programs and courses: Bachelor and Master, in courses in which learning programming is the learning goal, courses that require programming as a means to achieve another goal, and in courses in which programming is optional, but can be useful. We are also interested in changes over time, since GenAI capabilities are changing at a fast pace, and users are adopting GenAI increasingly. We conducted three consecutive surveys (fall ‘23, winter ‘23, and spring ‘24) among students of all computing programs of a large European research university. We asked questions on the use in education, ethics, and job prospects, and we included specific questions on the (dis)allowed use of GenAI tools in the courses they were taking at the time. We received 264 responses, which we quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed, to find out how students have employed GenAI tools across 59 different computing courses, and whether the opinion of an average student about these tools evolves over time. Our study contributes to the emerging discussion of how to differentiate GenAI use across different courses, and how to align its use with the learning goals of a computing course.},

  abstract = {As Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technologies evolve at an unprecedented rate, global governance approaches struggle to keep pace with the technology, highlighting a critical issue in the governance adaptation of significant challenges. Depicting the nuances of nascent and diverse governance approaches based on risks, rules, outcomes, principles, or a mix, across different regions around the globe, is fundamental to discern discrepancies and convergences, and to shed light on specific limitations that need to be addressed, thereby facilitating the safe and trustworthy adoption of GenAI. In response to the need and the evolving nature of GenAI, this paper seeks to provide a collective view of different governance approaches around the world. Our research introduces a Harmonized GenAI Framework, "H-GenAIGF", based on the current governance approaches of six regions: (European Union (EU), United States (US), China (CN), Canada (CA), United Kingdom (UK), and Singapore (SG)). We have identified four constituents, fifteen processes, twenty-five sub-processes, and nine principles that aid the governance of GenAI, thus providing a comprehensive perspective on the current state of GenAI governance. In addition, we present a comparative analysis to facilitate identification of common ground and distinctions based on coverage of the processes by each region. The results show that risk-based approaches allow for better coverage of the processes, followed by mixed approaches. Other approaches lag behind, covering less than 50% of the processes. Most prominently, the analysis demonstrates that amongst the regions, only one process aligns across all approaches, highlighting the lack of consistent and executable provisions. Moreover, our case study on ChatGPT reveals process coverage deficiency, showing that harmonization of approaches is necessary to find alignment for GenAI governance.},

My research is focused on the use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Special Education to help create more equitable learning environments for learners with disabilities. I hope to propose my dissertation studies plan by the end of August 2025. I will continue my research and plan to defend my dissertation in 2026. After I defend my dissertation, I would like to transition to a career in academia or work in a research lab. My dissertation is at the intersection of AI, Human-Computer Interaction, and inclusive education through the lens of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) [1]. Specifically, I am investigating how generative AI tools [2], such as large language models, can support special educators in designing accessible and personalized learning experiences for students with disabilities [4]. Previously, I contributed to research on DIY assistive technologies [3]. The first phase of my research included a qualitative interview study examining how K-12 special educators use and perceive AI. Findings highlighted opportunities and challenges of the use of AI. Concerns included lack of professional development, bias in AI, accessibility, and privacy issues. In the second phase, I conducted a focus group with special educators to understand how they have been using generative AI. I also conducted a participatory design session with one participant to discuss the design of an AI-enhanced tool they would like. These sessions provided an understanding of special educator experiences using AI to support neurodiverse learners. In the next phase of my research, I plan to conduct a qualitative study to understand how generative AI can assist parents and students in developing self-advocacy skills and in the creation of goals for their Individualized Education Plan (IEP) [5]. The study aims to understand experiences, perceptions, and needs of parents and students when using generative AI tools for self-advocacy.},

  abstract = {As generative artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more common in day-to-day life, AI-generated content (AIGC) needs to be accurate, relevant, and comprehensive. These characteristics typically are determined by subjective, human-based image quality assessment; however, there is limited research on the qualification of AI-generated image quality. Over 9,800 images were generated using Craiyon and OpenAI's DALL-E 2 text-to-image models and evaluated on the three criteria proposed for determining the quality of visual AIGC: (1) the number of objects, (2), resolution (strictly image quality; label/prompt exclusive), and (3) representativeness (consideration for how well the image matches the label/prompt). We observe that the paid, DALL-E 2 model, produced a dataset with fewer objects per image, higher resolution, and higher representativeness compared to Craiyon (free). There is an inverse relationship between the number of objects/images and its resolution and representativeness. This study establishes three subjective metrics for the evaluation of synthetic images to support the creation of more inclusive AIGC.},

Large text-to-image models can quickly generate aesthetically pleasing outcomes. However, the process can be non-deterministic and often involves tedious trial-and-error as users struggle to formulate effective prompts to achieve their desired results. This paper describes a generative approach that empowers users to easily work with a large text-to-image (TTI) model to create their preferred painterly content. The authors propose a large model personalization method, namely Semantic Injection, to personalize a large TTI model in a given specific artistic style, i.e., Kandinsky’s paintings in Bauhaus era, as the Artist Model. Through working with a Kandinsky expert, the authors first establish a semantic descriptive guideline and a TTI dataset of Kandinsky style and then apply the Semantic Injection method to obtain an Artist Model of Kandinsky, empowering users to create preferred Kandinsky content in a deterministically controllable manner.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary computation (EC) is a kind of artificial intelligence (AI) for optimization. However, traditional EC algorithms require the careful design of parameters and/or operators from experts. Designing an operator with generalization ability is a tough task, and the manually design process is often limited by the structures of existing operators, which lacks diversity. In order to explore operators with diverse structures and good generalization ability so as to provide inspiration for the manually design of operators, this paper proposes a generative EC approach for the automatic design of operators by using genetic programming (GP). We apply the generative approach to a typical EC variant named gene targeting differential evolution (GTDE), so as to propose a new automatic GTDE (AGTDE) algorithm. The AGTDE utilizes the advantage of GP in optimizing structural features to automatically generate and refine the targeting vector generation operator within GTDE. This way, the operator of AGTDE is generated automatically rather than manually designed, which is more robust and optimal. The experimental results demonstrate that AGTDE is capable of identifying appropriate and even better operator for solving optimization problems, when compared with GTDE with manually design operator. Moreover, the results show that the operator obtained for one problem can be applied to other problems and obtain promising results, which reflect the robustness and generalization ability of the operator generated by GP. Therefore, this generative approach may provide some novel avenues of thought for the automatically design of EC algorithm operators.},

But exams do not afford more authentic programming experiences that involve planning, implementing, and debugging programs with computer interaction. In this experience report, we describe code interviews: a more authentic assessment method for take-home programming assignments. Through action research, we experimented with the number and type of questions as well as whether interviews were conducted individually or with groups of students. To scale the program, we converted most of our weekly teaching assistant (TA) sections to conduct code interviews on 5 major weekly take-home programming assignments. By triangulating data from 5 sources, we identified 4 themes. Code interviews (1) pushed students to discuss their work, motivating more nuanced but sometimes repetitive insights; (2) enabled peer learning, reducing stress in some ways but increasing stress in other ways; (3) scaled with TA-led sections, replacing familiar practice with an unfamiliar assessment; (4) focused on student contributions, limiting opportunities for TAs to give guidance and feedback.

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence tools (Generative AI), such as ChatGPT, allow users to interact with them in intuitive ways (e.g., conversational) and receive (mostly) good-quality answers. In education, such systems can support students’ learning objectives by providing accessible explanations and examples even when students pose vague queries. But, they also encourage undesired help-seeking behaviors, such as by providing solutions to the students’ homework. Therefore, it is important to better understand how students approach such tools and the potential issues such approaches might present for the learners.In this paper, we present a case study for understanding student-AI collaboration to solve programming tasks in the CS1 introductory programming course. To this end, we recruited a gender-balanced majority non-white set of 15 CS1 students at the University of Houston, a large public university in the US. We observed them solving programming tasks. We used a mixed-method approach to study their interactions as they tackled Python programming tasks, focusing on when and why they used ChatGPT for problem-solving. We analyze and classify the questions submitted by the 15 participants to ChatGPT. Additionally, we analyzed user interaction patterns, their reactions to ChatGPT’s responses, and the potential impacts of Generative AI on their perception of self-efficacy.Our results suggest that, in about a third of the cases, the student attempted to complete the task by submitting the full description of the tasks to ChatGPT without making any effort on their own. We also observed that few students verified their solutions. We discuss the potential implications of these results.},

  abstract = {Self-adaptive systems (SASs) are designed to handle changes and uncertainties through a feedback loop with four core functionalities: monitoring, analyzing, planning, and execution. Recently, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), especially the area of large language models, has shown impressive performance in data comprehension and logical reasoning. These capabilities are highly aligned with the functionalities required in SASs, suggesting a strong potential to employ GenAI to enhance SASs. However, the specific benefits and challenges of employing GenAI in SASs remain unclear. Yet, providing a comprehensive understanding of these benefits and challenges is complex due to several reasons: limited publications in the SAS field, the technological and application diversity within SASs, and the rapid evolution of GenAI technologies. To that end, this article aims to provide researchers and practitioners a comprehensive snapshot that outlines the potential benefits and challenges of employing GenAI’s within SAS. Specifically, we gather, filter, and analyze literature from four distinct research fields and organize them into two main categories to potential benefits: (i) enhancements to the autonomy of SASs centered around the specific functions of the MAPE-K feedback loop, and (ii) improvements in the interaction between humans and SASs within human-on-the-loop settings. From our study, we outline a research roadmap that highlights the challenges of integrating GenAI into SASs. The roadmap starts with outlining key research challenges that need to be tackled to exploit the potential for applying GenAI in the field of SAS. The roadmap concludes with a practical reflection, elaborating on current shortcomings of GenAI and proposing possible mitigation strategies.†},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has made unprecedented advances in vision language models over the past two years. These advances are largely due to diffusion-based generative models, which are very stable and simple to train. These diffusion models are tasked to learn the underlying unknown distribution of the training data samples. During the generative process, new samples (images) are generated from this unknown high-dimensional distribution. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are particularly effective in drawing samples from complex, high-dimensional distributions. This makes MCMC methods an integral component for both the training and sampling phases of these models, ensuring accurate sample generation.Gradient-based optimization is at the core of modern generative models. The update step during the optimization forms a Markov chain where the new update depends only on the current state. This allows exploration of the parameter space in a memoryless manner, thus combining the benefits of gradient-based optimization and MCMC sampling. MCMC methods have shown an equally important role in physically based rendering where complex light paths are otherwise quite challenging to sample from simple importance sampling techniques.A lot of research is dedicated towards bringing physical realism to samples (images) generated from diffusion-based generative models in a data-driven manner, however, a unified framework connecting these techniques is still missing. In this course, we take the first steps toward understanding each of these components and exploring how MCMC could potentially serve as a bridge, linking these closely related areas of research. Our tutorial aims to provide necessary theoretical and practical tools to guide students, researchers and practitioners towards the common goal of generative physically based rendering.

  abstract = {As Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) becomes an increasingly significant part of young people’s lives, educators worry about its impact on learning and attainment. However, understanding this impact requires more than simply studying young people’s behaviours or soliciting their opinions. It is essential to involve them actively as co-researchers, allowing their unique perspectives to shape the conversation around GenAI in schools. This project moves beyond seeing young people as research subjects, positioning them instead as co-designers, co-researchers, and potential influencers of national policy on GenAI in education. We recruited eight young people (aged 16–18) from three Scottish high schools to serve as Young People Co-Researchers (YPCR). Together, we explored their perspectives on GenAI at school, including their current usage, views on appropriate tasks for AI, and opinions on teachers’ use of AI. The YPCR organised and conducted semi-structured focus groups with 50 peers and collaboratively analysed the findings with adult researchers. Our results show that young people are cautiously optimistic about GenAI’s potential for learning and do not support outright bans in schools. They clearly distinguish between AI use for learning and in assessments, often expressing confusion over current policies and wishing for clearer guidance. The YPCR stated a strong desire to deepen their understanding of AI’s advantages and risks and for schools to teach responsible, effective use. Their insights are valuable for national policy development and for AI literacy initiatives.},

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models have emerged to address this challenge, offering the capability to synthesize human motion animations from text prompts. However, the effective integration of AI-generated motion into professional designer workflows remains uncertain. This study proposes MoWa, an authoring tool designed to refine AI-generated human motions to meet professional standards. A formative study with six professional motion designers identified the strengths and weaknesses of AI-generated motions. To address these weaknesses, MoWa utilizes latent space to enhance the expressiveness of motions, making them suitable for use in professional workflows. A user study involving twelve professional motion designers was conducted to evaluate MoWa’s effectiveness in refining AI-generated motions. The results indicated that MoWa streamlines the motion design process and improves the quality of the outcomes. These findings suggest that incorporating latent space into motion design tasks can improve efficiency.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence extends beyond its success in image/text synthesis, proving itself a powerful uncertainty quantification (UQ) technique through its capability to sample from complex high-dimensional probability distributions. However, existing methods often require a complicated training process, which greatly hinders their applications to real-world UQ problems, especially in dynamic UQ tasks where the target probability distribution evolves rapidly with time. To alleviate this challenge, we have developed a scalable, training-free score-based diffusion model for high-dimensional sampling. We incorporate a parallel-in-time method into our diffusion model to use a large number of GPUs to solve the backward stochastic differential equation and generate new samples of the target distribution. Moreover, we also distribute the computation of the large matrix subtraction used by the training-free score estimator onto multiple GPUs available across all nodes. Compared to existing methods, our approach completely avoids training the score function, making it capable of adapting to rapid changes in the target probability distribution. We showcase the remarkable strong and weak scaling capabilities of the proposed method on the Frontier supercomputer, as well as its uncertainty reduction capability in hurricane predictions when coupled with AI-based foundation models.},

By utilizing concise text prompts, Stable Diffusion is capable of producing images that are either strikingly realistic or visually stunning, bridging the gap between textual descriptions and visual representations. A notable challenge associated with Stable Diffusion is the retrieval of corresponding prompts from generated images. To tackle this challenge, we employed a strategy that leverages the capabilities of the ConvNeXt model within the OpenCLIP framework. Having trained the model on an extensive dataset of nearly 2.1 million Stable Diffusion generated images, we then subjected our approach to the evaluation of the Kaggle Stable Diffusion - Image to Prompts competition. The effectiveness of our methodology is underscored by a mean cosine similarity score of 0.63032 between the predicted and actual prompt embedding vectors on the private test set, securing a silver medal position. This achievement not only attests to the robustness of our approach but also signifies its potential in diverse sectors where the retrieval of text from images is of great importance.},

While the GenAI in the workplace is new, the few studies suggest several benefits of such systems in work contexts. However, these results focus on the quantitative indicators, and further literature on the implementation of generative AI systems at work is still scarce. In this context, it is important to specify how to integrate a GenAI-based tool into an existing socio-technical organisation, as such integration always deeply transforms the employees’ activity. In this paper, we discuss the human-centred design of GenAI-based tools on the basis of an ergonomics intervention for the Ombudsman's team of an energy utility company. We explore how a participatory design approach – grounded in the preliminary analysis of the work – can help inform the development of a GenAI-based tool. We discuss the relevance of this methodology and the intermediary role of the ergonomists, given the dual challenge that end-users often lack a comprehensive understanding of GenAI's possibilities and potential applications, while data-scientists responsible for developing such tools are not trained to analyse complex work activities, which is a necessary step for selecting and training the appropriate AI models.},

  abstract = {AI/ML techniques have been used to solve systems problems, but their applicability to customize solutions on-the-fly has been limited. Traditionally, any customization required manually changing the AI/ML model or modifying the code, configuration parameters, application settings, etc. This incurs too much time and effort, and is very painful. In this paper, we propose a novel technique using Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technology, wherein instructions can be provided in natural language and actual code to handle any customization is automatically generated, integrated and applied on-the-fly. Such capability is extremely powerful since it makes customization of application settings or solution techniques super easy. Specifically, we propose ECO-LLM (LLM-based Edge Cloud Optimization), which leverages Large Language Models (LLM) to dynamically adjust placement of application tasks across edge and cloud computing tiers, in response to changes in application workload, such that insights are delivered quickly with low cost of operation (systems problem). Our experiments with real-world video analytics applications i.e. face recognition, human attributes detection and license plate recognition show that ECO-LLM is able to automatically generate code on-the-fly and adapt placement of application tasks across edge and cloud computing tiers. We note that the trigger workload (to switch between edge and cloud) for ECO-LLM is exactly the same as the baseline (manual) and actual placement performed by ECO-LLM is only slightly different i.e. on average (across 2 days) only 1.45% difference in human attributes detection and face recognition, and 1.11% difference in license plate recognition. Although we tackle this specific systems problem in this paper, our proposed GenAI-based technique is applicable to solve other systems problems too.},

However, most existing approaches rely on single-agent systems, which fail to fully utilize the collaborative potential of multiple AI agents. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent collaboration system designed to enhance decision-making in financial investment research. The system incorporates agent groups with both configurable group sizes and collaboration structures to leverage the strengths of each agent group type. By utilizing a sub-optimal combination strategy, the system dynamically adapts to varying market conditions and investment scenarios, optimizing performance across different tasks. We focus on three sub-tasks: fundamentals, market sentiment, and risk analysis, by analyzing the 2023 SEC 10-K forms of 30 companies listed on the Dow Jones Index. Our findings reveal significant performance variations based on the configurations of AI agents for different tasks. The results demonstrate that our multi-agent collaboration system outperforms traditional single-agent models, offering improved accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability in complex financial environments. This study highlights the potential of multi-agent systems in transforming financial analysis and investment decision-making by integrating diverse analytical perspectives.},

  abstract = {Conceptual design is an important stage in industrial product development, influenced by the design space and materials available to designers. Advancements in human-computer interaction&nbsp;(HCI) and artificial intelligence&nbsp;(AI) technologies have broadened these aspects considerably. On the one hand, augmented reality&nbsp;(AR) technologies merge physical and virtual representations to enhance intuitive interaction and embodied cognition. On the other hand, generative artificial intelligence&nbsp;(GAI) serves as a novel design material, boosting creativity and productivity. Inspired by these technological strides, we proposed an Intelli-Embodied Design Space&nbsp;(IEDS), which integrates designers, AR, and GAI to support industrial conceptual design by combining embodied interaction with generative variability. Within IEDS, designers can interact with the physical prototypes intuitively, while GAI refines these into virtual forms that can be embedded in the physical world through AR technology. In this study, we established the theoretical framework and interaction modes of IEDS through literature reviews and expert interviews. Subsequently, we designed and implemented three GAI+AR tools, GAI + Head-mounted Display&nbsp;(HMD), GAI + Handheld Display&nbsp;(HHD), and GAI + Spatial Augmented Reality&nbsp;(SAR), based on three AR approaches in IEDS to practically examine the benefits and challenges of these interaction modes across industrial conceptual design tasks. We discussed IEDS’s influence on industrial conceptual design and released its application guidelines to the HCI community.},

In this paper, we posit that designing human-centered text-to-image AI tools requires a clear understanding of how individuals intuitively approach crafting prompts, and what challenges they may encounter. To address this, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 existing users of a text-to-image AI tool. Our findings (1) offer insights into users’ prompt journey including structures and processes for writing, evaluating, and refining prompts in text-to-image AI tools and (2) indicate that users must overcome barriers to aligning AI to their intents, and mastering prompt crafting knowledge. From the findings, we discuss the prompt journey as an individual yet a social experience and highlight opportunities for aligning text-to-image AI tools and users’ intents.},

One notable consequence is the use of AI-generated images for fake profiles on social media. While several types of disinformation campaigns and similar incidents have been reported in the past, a systematic analysis has been lacking. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale investigation of the prevalence of AI-generated profile pictures on Twitter. We tackle the challenges of a real-world measurement study by carefully integrating various data sources and designing a multi-stage detection pipeline. Our analysis of nearly 15 million Twitter profile pictures shows that 0.052% were artificially generated, confirming their notable presence on the platform. We comprehensively examine the characteristics of these accounts and their tweet content, and uncover patterns of coordinated inauthentic behavior. The results also reveal several motives, including spamming and political amplification campaigns. Our research reaffirms the need for effective detection and mitigation strategies to cope with the potential negative effects of generative AI in the future.},

  abstract = {Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) represent a significant share of global resource usage. Notably, the energy consumption of data centres has emerged as a critical concern, escalating rapidly, especially with the rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. This surge in energy demand calls for efforts focused on measuring and reducing the energy and carbon footprints of components used in ICT service delivery. However, the variety and multitude of devices involved in these services make it challenging to accurately measure and evaluate these footprints.In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to assess energy impacts by considering data centres for what they are: throughput computing systems offering ICT services. We define a simple experimental testbed and evaluate several machines with different hardware capacities. These machines serve two ICT services: a loop incrementing a counter until a defined limit, and an AI inference predicting the next token based on an input.Our experiment highlights three main take-aways: (a) the CPU usage is a poor predictor of the power consumption, (b) the energy or CO2 quantity associated with a service visit highly depends on the total load the service is facing, and (c) modern machines do not yield better energy figures compared to older ones in all circumstances.},

  abstract = {Recently, creative generative artificial intelligence software has emerged as a pivotal assistant, enabling users to generate content and seek inspiration rapidly. Text-to-Image (T2I) software, one of the most widely used, synthesizes images with text input by engaging in a cross-modal process. However, despite substantial advancements in the T2I engine, T2I software still encounters errors when generating complex or non-realistic scenes, including omitting focal entities, low image realism, and mismatched text-image information. The cross-modal nature of T2I software complicates error detection for traditional testing methods, and the absence of test oracles further exacerbates the complexity of the testing process. To fill this gap, we propose ACTesting, an Automated Cross-modal Testing Method of Text-to-Image Software, the first testing method explicitly designed for T2I software. ACTesting utilizes the metamorphic testing principle to address the oracle problem and identifies cross-modal semantic consistency as its fundamental Metamorphic relation (MR) by employing the Entity-relationship (ER) triples. We design three kinds of mutation operators under the guidance of MR and the adaptability density constraint to construct the new input text. After generating the images based on the text, ACTesting verifies whether MR is satisfied by detecting the ER triples across two modalities to detect the errors of T2I software. In our experiments across five popular T2I software, ACTesting effectively generates error-revealing tests, resulting in a decrease in text-image consistency by up to 20% when compared to the baseline. Additionally, an ablation study demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed mutation operators. The experimental results validate that ACTesting can reliably identify errors within T2I software.},

With the increasing availability of generative Artificial Intelligence Assistants, there is a renewed push to focus on higher-order skills beyond syntax and solving programming problems by matching sample outputs.This poster examines the impact of conceptual explanation-based exercises in introductory programming courses through the implementation of a scaffolded semi-flipped classroom. This method is currently in its third semester as a part of an ongoing, iterative, semi-experimental approach to support student resilience in entrance-level courses. This approach aimed to enhance student engagement, retention, and performance by integrating weekly practice sessions and "group-tutoring" sessions facilitated by peer learning assistants. In these sessions, students were encouraged to articulate their problem-solving strategies and the reasoning behind their solutions, fostering a deeper understanding of programming language paradigms and problem-solving techniques.The findings indicate that this method significantly increased classroom engagement, as students became more active participants in their learning journey. Retention rates improved as students became more confident in understanding and applying programming concepts. Overall, student performance saw a notable rise, with students demonstrating a better grasp of programming paradigms and problem-solving approaches beyond rote memorization and matching sample outputs.},

Employing the Gioia methodology, we derived a theoretical model of AI adoption in software engineering: the Human-AI Collaboration and Adaptation Framework. This model was then validated using Partial Least Squares–Structural Equation Modeling based on data from 183 software engineers. Findings indicate that at this early stage of AI integration, the compatibility of AI tools within existing development workflows predominantly drives their adoption, challenging conventional technology acceptance theories. The impact of perceived usefulness, social factors, and personal innovativeness seems less pronounced than expected.

This study draws on the key concepts of Effective Use theory—Transparent Interaction, Representational Fidelity, Informed Action, and Learning and Adaptation—to examine ChatGPT's current state of diffusion in four public sector domains: transportation, healthcare, agriculture, and law. We find that transparent interaction is better in transportation, agriculture, and law than healthcare; representational fidelity presents a complex picture, whereas informed action has been positive across domains; and learning and adaptation is an ongoing need. We conclude with various suggestions related to research and policy toward boosting GenAI's adoption.

The study takes an in-pieces approach to investigate novices’ conceptions of GLMs. Such an approach supports the analysis of how technical and ethical conceptions evolve and relate to each other. I am currently conducting a series of participatory design workshops with sixteen ninth graders (ages 14–15) in which they will (a) build GLMs from a data-driven perspective that glassboxes how data shapes model performance and (b) audit commercial GLMs by repeatedly and systematically querying them to draw inferences about their behaviors. I will analyze participants’ interactions to identify ethical and technical conceptions they may exhibit while designing and auditing GLMs. Then I will investigate the contexts in which these conceptions emerge and how participants’ personal interests and prior experiences may relate to their conceptions. I will also conduct clinical interviews and use microgenetic knowledge analysis and ordered network analysis to investigate how participants’ ethical and technical conceptions of GLMs relate to each other and change after the workshop. The study will contribute (a) evidence of how engaging youth in design and auditing activities may support the development of ethical and technical understanding of GLMs and (b) an inventory of novice design and auditing practices that may support youth’s technical and ethical understanding of GLMs.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Increased use of generative artificial intelligence or AI in various academic activities such as programming is a significant milestone in technology diffusion in learning. To bring AI closer to how programmers think, behave, and interact, it is imperative for research to establish a clear connection between various human factors that lead to its adoption. Using a model based on the Theory of Reasoned Action, we positioned human traits of academic stress, risk propensity, neuroticism, and computer self-efficacy as factors that positively influence attitudes toward the use of AI in programming among university students. We further posited that attitude and social norms lead to the behavioral intention to use AI in programming. We used PLS-SEM to analyze responses from 131 programming students who use ChatGPT to accomplish learning tasks. We found that both academic stress and computer self-efficacy influence attitudes toward using AI in programming. While attitude positively influences the behavioral intention to use ChatGPT, we found that risk propensity and neuroticism do not affect attitude, and social norms do not influence behavioral intention. We discuss the implications of our investigation to the industry and the academe.},

The aim of the study is to analyze the current status of ChatGPT research in higher education applications and to explore the hot issues surrounding ChatGPT empowerment in higher education.The study points out that current research in higher education in the era of artificial intelligence mainly focuses on introducing ChatGPT, the characteristics and connotations of large language models, and discussing the opportunities, challenges, coping strategies, and digital transformation research they bring. However, there is still a lack of in-depth exploration of the application of ChatGPT and other technologies in education, especially in areas such as personalized learning and precision teaching, the integration of virtual and actual teaching spaces, intelligent teaching facilities and resources, human-computer collaborative teaching methods, and interdisciplinary innovative research methods.We should actively respond to the opportunities and challenges brought by intelligent tools such as ChatGPT to higher education, and comprehensively and deeply explore how to integrate ChatGPT into key areas of digital education, including teaching design, teaching resource development, teaching organization and implementation, teaching evaluation and reflection, learning and personal knowledge management, innovation team building, and enhancing the digital literacy and professional capabilities of teachers and students. In addition, the impact of the application of ChatGPT and other technologies in education on educational equity, and how to ensure that all students can benefit from it through reasonable design and use, should also be of concern. The goal of this study is to further promote and drive the digital transformation of higher education by building a brand new higher education ecosystem based on ChatGPT.},

  abstract = {Recent advancements in large language model-based generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools have transformed computer science education, presenting both opportunities and challenges. A study investigating students' attitudes toward these tools was conducted during an Introduction to Computer Science course. The target of the study was to gauge students' evolving attitudes toward using GenAI tools in the course, before, during and after ChatGPT was gradually assimilated into homework assignments. The study refers to three phases: preliminary phase, assimilation phase, and calibration stage, which currently takes place. Findings show that, in the preliminary phase, students appreciated the efficiency of GenAI tools offered but were concerned about developing a dependency on these tools and about ''cheating''. Findings from the assimilation phase indicate that consistent, guided exposure to GenAI tools positively shifted students' views, alleviating initial concerns and promoting a positive attitude toward using GenAI tools in the course. The targets of the calibration phase are: a) to examine how to leverage independent learning by formulating clear guidelines that can build trust in the technology and help overcome concerns regarding reliability and credibility; b) to check how GenAI can help students in a Introduction to Computer Science course acquire skills such as critical thinking and code comprehension. The study offers insights for educators on the integration of GenAI tools into computer science courses to enhance learning while maintaining academic integrity.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to simulate rare disease situations. This is a potential way to train robotic systems, especially for medical actions. It can be hard to get real-world data for training because trends in rare diseases are often complicated, varied, and hard to predict. This can make it time-consuming, expensive, and morally problematic. Generative AI models, like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variation Autoencoders (VAEs), can make fake but real medical situations that show how complicated rare diseases are. It is easy to make different datasets with these AI-driven models. These datasets can then be used to train robots so they can do complicated medical treatments more accurately and quickly By adding these AI models to artificial training environments, it is possible to create many rare disease cases that would be hard to make in regular training settings. The models improve robots' abilities to make smart choices, deal with new problems, and guess how patients will do in real time by exposing them to a lot of different situations. Using generative AI also cuts down on the need for real patient data, which protects privacy while still providing the reality needed for effective training. This method not only makes medical robots better at their jobs and more flexible in situations involving rare diseases, but it also makes it easier for them to keep learning. The robots can get better at making decisions by going through virtual situations that get more complicated. In the end, this study looks at how generative AI could be used to make computer systems that are smarter and can react to rare diseases. This would make medical treatments in these specialized fields more accurate and safer.},

  abstract = {The rapidly increasing amount of online information and the advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) make the manual verification of information impractical. Consequently, AI systems are deployed to detect disinformation and deepfakes. Prior studies have indicated that combining AI and human capabilities yields enhanced performance in detecting disinformation. Furthermore, the European Union (EU) AI Act mandates human supervision for AI applications in areas impacting essential human rights, like freedom of speech, necessitating that AI systems be transparent and provide adequate explanations to ensure comprehensibility. Extensive research has been conducted on incorporating explainability (XAI) attributes to augment AI transparency, yet these often miss a human-centric assessment. The effectiveness of such explanations also varies with the user’s prior knowledge and personal attributes. Therefore, we developed a framework for validating XAI features for the collaborative human-AI fact-checking task. The framework allows the testing of XAI features with objective and subjective evaluation dimensions and follows human-centric design principles when displaying information about the AI system to the users. The framework was tested in a crowdsourcing experiment with 433 participants, including 406 crowdworkers and 27 journalists for the collaborative disinformation detection task. The tested XAI features increase the AI system’s perceived usefulness, understandability, and trust. With this publication, the XAI evaluation framework is made open source.},

In this article, we systematically review the extent to which DALL-E Mini suffers from this problem. In line with the Model Card published alongside DALL-E Mini by its creators, we find that the images it produces tend to represent dozens of different occupations as populated either solely by men (e.g., pilot, builder, plumber) or solely by women (e.g., hairdresser, receptionist, dietitian). In addition, the images DALL-E Mini produces tend to represent most occupations as populated primarily or solely by White people (e.g., farmer, painter, prison officer, software engineer) and very few by non-White people (e.g., pastor, rapper). These findings suggest that exciting new AI technologies should be critically scrutinized and perhaps regulated before they are unleashed on society.},

In particular, text-to-image generation models offer a novel approach to guiding the image generation process using natural language input, which is inspiring for multimodal search advertising. Traditional multimodal search ads require advertisers to prepare ad creatives, such as ad images, which is time-consuming and requires uniform image specifications and content quality inspection. To this end, we propose a streamlined generation framework for search ad image creatives. First, we prepare a Chinese image caption model with high-quality image-caption pairs to bootstrap training data refinement. With curated high-quality images and synthesized descriptive captions, we then train a Chinese text-to-image generation model, the largest to date, using SDXL and a 10-billion multimodal text encoder. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage bilingual multimodal representation alignment process to seamlessly integrate the text encoder with the generation model. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, including assessments of image captioning and image generation. The implementation of our framework in Baidu Search Ads shows significant revenue increase, For example, beauty industry ads with generated image creatives achieve a 29% higher click-through rate (CTR).},

Automatically measuring how close the generated data distribution is to the target distribution is central to diagnosing existing models and developing better ones. We present MAUVE, a family of comparison measures between pairs of distributions such as those encountered in the generative modeling of text or images. These scores are statistical summaries of divergence frontiers capturing two types of errors in generative modeling. We explore three approaches to statistically estimate these scores: vector quantization, non-parametric estimation, and classifier-based estimation. We provide statistical bounds for the vector quantization approach.Empirically, we find that the proposed scores paired with a range of f-divergences and statistical estimation methods can quantify the gaps between the distributions of humanwritten text and those of modern neural language models by correlating with human judgments and identifying known properties of the generated texts. We demonstrate in the vision domain that MAUVE can identify known properties of generated images on par with or better than existing metrics. In conclusion, we present practical recommendations for using MAUVE effectively with language and image modalities.},

In these so-called brownfield software development settings, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) coding assistants like GitHub Copilot are rapidly transforming software development practices, yet the impact of GenAI on student programmers performing brownfield development tasks remains underexplored. This paper investigates how GitHub Copilot influences undergraduate students’ programming performance, behaviors, and understanding when completing brownfield programming tasks in which they add new code to an unfamiliar code base. We conducted a controlled experiment in which 10 undergraduate computer science students completed highly similar brownfield development tasks with and without Copilot in a legacy web application. Using a mixed-methods approach combining performance analysis, behavioral analysis, and exit interviews, we found that students completed tasks 34.9% faster (p &lt; 0.05) and made 50.0% more solution progress (p &lt; 0.05) when using Copilot. Moreover, our analysis revealed that, when using Copilot, students spent 10.6% less time manually writing code (p &lt; 0.05), and 11.6% less time conducting web searches (p &lt; 0.05), providing evidence of a fundamental shift in how they engaged in programming. In exit interviews, students reported concerns about not understanding how or why Copilot suggestions work. This research suggests the need for computing educators to develop new pedagogical approaches that leverage GenAI assistants’ benefits while fostering reflection on how and why GenAI suggestions address brownfield programming tasks.

We further propose an adaptive modality selection strategy to facilitate model learning. Besides, a variety of data augmentation techniques are incorporated for audio-visual branches to enhance the robustness of the AV-LGNN.

This introduces significant challenges to distinguishing AI-synthesized speech from the authentic human voice and could raise potential issues of misuse for malicious purposes such as impersonation and fraud, spreading misinformation, deepfakes, and scams. However, existing detection techniques for AI-synthesized audio have not kept pace and often exhibit poor generalization across diverse datasets. In this article, we introduce SONAR, a synthetic AI-Audio Detection Framework and Benchmark, aiming at providing a comprehensive evaluation for distinguishing cutting-edge AI-synthesized auditory content. SONAR includes a novel evaluation dataset sourced from 9 diverse audio synthesis platforms, including leading TTS providers and state-of-the-art TTS models. It is the first framework to uniformly benchmark AI-audio detection across both traditional and foundation model-based deepfake detection systems. Through extensive experiments, (1) we reveal the generalization limitations of existing detection methods and demonstrate that foundation models exhibit stronger generalization capabilities, which can be attributed to their model size and the scale and quality of pretraining data. (2) Our evaluation of the generalization across languages suggests that speech foundation models demonstrate robust cross-lingual generalization capabilities, maintaining strong performance across diverse languages despite being fine-tuned solely on English speech data. This finding also suggests that the primary challenges in audio deepfake detection are more closely tied to the realism and quality of synthetic audio rather than language-specific characteristics. (3) We also explore the effectiveness and efficiency of few-shot fine-tuning in improving generalization, highlighting its potential for tailored applications, such as personalized detection systems for specific entities or individuals.

  abstract = {Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence have revolutionized information retrieval and content generation, opening up new opportunities for the e-commerce industry. Alignment learning between small models and parallel corpora cannot meet current needs. The success of ChatGPT demonstrates that large models need to first establish a fundamental understanding, and then utilize high-quality corpora for generation. Having a large model foundation is indispensable. In this paper, we establish a fundamental 10B multimodal model foundation for multimodal generation tasks and propose a scene-based alignment learning approach called conditional sample supervised fine-tuning for downstream generation tasks. Meanwhile, diffusion models are known to be vulnerable to outliers in training data. To address this, we utilize an alternative diffusion loss function that preserves the high quality of generated data like the original squared L2 loss while being robust to outliers.In practical test sets, the multimodal foundation fully demonstrates its alignment and comprehension abilities for graphic and textual content. Additionally, conditional fine-tuning and the design of the loss function significantly enhance the quality of generated content. The quality rate of images has increased by 34.3 percentage points, and prompt control has improved by 19.8 percentage points. The application of our framework in Baidu Search Ads has led to significant revenue growth. For instance, ads with generated image creatives have achieved a 29% higher click-through rate (CTR), resulting in a daily consumption of 3 million yuan.},

Thanks to generative artificial intelligence, tools that once could only be used by highly qualified technical personnel are now in the hands of potentially inexperienced users, but unfortunately, the understanding of the layman is very far from the machinery behind the scenes. More than ever, it is necessary to help people develop an awareness that allows them to use these tools in an appropriate way and with the appropriate expectations. We believe this problem should be addressed by exploring ways to train thinking strategies to facilitate understanding of machine learning concepts that can be applied in daily life, not just by developing teaching tools on this or that topic.

Yet we know little about the designers’ perceptions and practices of collaborating with generative AI as a co-creative agent within the context of multi-stakeholder participation. To investigate these questions, we took the domain of avatar design as an example and conducted a qualitative interview study with 21 expert avatar designers who have got different levels of experience and expertise in utilizing generative AI tools in their design workflow. We found that designers not only would fall in a dilemma when deciding whether to consider AI as a co-creative agent according to different stakeholders’ interests, but they also face many challenges in effectively co-creating with the current systems, including challenges in consistently adjusting AI outputs and getting design inspiration within the iterative generation process, etc. Based on our findings, we concluded both the epistemological and creative patterns of collaborating with generative AI and highlighted several design opportunities from both technical and ethical perspectives to better support future designer-AI co-creation.},

To cope with this issue, heterogeneous NoCs are promising alternatives. Nevertheless, the design of optimized NoCs satisfying multiple performance objectives is extremely challenging and requires significant expertise. Prior works failed to combine many objectives or required an extended design space exploration time. In this paper, we propose an approach based on generative artificial intelligence to help pruning complex design spaces for heterogeneous NoCs, according to configurable performance objectives. This is made possible by the ability of Generative Adversarial Networks to learn and generate relevant design candidates for the target NoCs. The speed and flexibility of our solution enable a fast generation of optimized NoCs that fit users' expectations. Through some experiments, we show how to obtain competitive NoC designs reducing the power consumption with no communication performance or area penalty compared to a given conventional NoC design.},

Ideally, using theories could provide conceptual clarity and guide and ground conversational agents designed for trust. We conducted a scoping review on how systematically trust is being designed for in conversational agents. The review shows that although the conversational agent work is well grounded, the variation in referential theories used, manipulations chosen, and measures used is high. Moreover, the relation between these dimensions is not always explicitly explained. This hinders the abstraction of more generalizable research findings. We conclude with the suggestion for the development of more intermediate levels of knowledge in the context of designing for trust in conversational agents.},

These benchmark datasets, however, are often constructed through arbitrary processes that fall short in encapsulating the depth and breadth of the tasks they are intended to measure. In this paper, we interrogate the naturalization of benchmark datasets as veracious metrics by examining the historical development of benchmarking as an epistemic practice in AI research. Specifically, we highlight three key case studies that were crucial in establishing the existing reliance on benchmark datasets for evaluating the capabilities of AI systems: (1) the sharing of Highleyman’s OCR dataset in the 1960s, which solidified a community of knowledge production around a shared benchmark dataset, (2) the Common Task Framework (CTF) of the 1980s, a state-led project to standardize benchmark datasets as legitimate indicators of technical progress; and (3) the Netflix Prize which further solidified benchmarking as a competitive goal within the ML research community. This genealogy highlights how contemporary dynamics and limitations of benchmarking developed from a longer history of collaboration, standardization, and competition. We end with reflections on how this history informs our understanding of benchmarking in the current era of generative artificial intelligence.},

Although this technology has raised great concerns about its misuse and harmful applications, it holds great potential to revolutionize traditional ways of teaching and learning. The use of GenAI in education has increased markedly, however, pedagogical research on this rapidly emerging technology is yet to be studied extensively. There is an urgent need to investigate the unexamined potential of this technology. Therefore, this ongoing research will explore the potential of AI-generated pedagogical agents (PA), or avatars, in instructional videos to facilitate learning. The effects of the type of PA (AI-generated, real-life human), and voice (AI-generated, human voice) on an individual's learning outcomes, cognitive load, motivation, and attention will be studied. Findings from a pilot study provide some preliminary evidence that PA appearance influences learners’ retention and cognitive load, but not attention.

  abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is driving significant environmental impacts. The rapid development and deployment of larger algorithmic models consumes substantially more energy than traditional models, contributing to rising carbon emissions, water withdrawal, and e-waste generation. To mitigate these impacts, big tech companies are developing different strategies such as turning to nuclear energy to meet the demand for GenAI electricity and avoid carbon emissions, an approach that could have profound social and environmental implications beyond carbon reduction.This paper proposes a critical rethinking of GenAI’s proliferation through an ecofeminist framing, which has historically interrogated the role of science and technology in the context of gender and environmental justice. To do so, it introduces seven data ecofeminist principles delineating a pathway for developing technological and just transition alternatives within the AI research context, emphasising a critical examination of this technology’s role in the current socio-ecological crisis. The paper calls for an urgent reassessment of the GenAI innovation race, advocating for ecological and feminist technological projects that prioritise and respect life, people, and the planet.},

At the same time, with the change of the subject of collaborative problem solving, the cultivation of collaborative problem-solving skill urgently needs to explore a new path. In this regard, more and more studies have begun to apply conversational agents in collaborative problem-solving activities, digging deeper into the effects of time on students in conversational agents. However, there is no clear answer to the question of how conversational agents can be better integrated into a collaborative environment for all to assist people in the collaborative problem-solving process and improve performance. In this study, we constructed a conceptual model of human-computer collaboration in order to improve students' learning performance. Based on this model, we integrated Retrieval-Augmented Generative and GPT to construct a conversational agent, and the results of the study showed that the Retrieval-Augmented Generative Agent for Collaborative Problem Solving constructed in this study can effectively promote students' collaborative problem-solving performance.},

  abstract = {The rapid advancements of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) have recently led to renewed attention towards approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search and vector databases (VectorDB). Among various ANN methodologies, vector quantization techniques like product quantization (PQ) are widely used to generate space-efficient representations for large-scale dense vectors. However, the code-books generated by PQ often reach several gigabytes in size, making them impractical for web-scale, high-dimensional vectors in resource-constrained environments like mobile devices.In this study, we propose SegPQ, a simple yet effective framework for losslessly compressing codebooks generated by any PQ variants, enabling efficient in-memory vector search on devices with limited memory. SegPQ represents the raw PQ codewords as a trained error-bounded piecewise linear approximation model (ϵ-PLA) and pre-computed low-bit residuals. We theoretically demonstrate that, with high probability, the number of bits per compressed codeword is 1.721 + ⌈log2 ϵOPT⌉, where ϵOPT is the optimal error parameter that can be determined by data characteristics. To accelerate query execution, we further design SIMD-aware query processing algorithms on compressed codebooks to fully exploit the hardware parallelism offered by modern architectures. Extensive experimental studies on real datasets showcase that, for 1 billion vectors, SegPQ reduces PQ codebook memory consumption by up to 4.7x (approx. 851 MB) while incurring only 3.3% additional query processing overhead caused by decompression.},

The objective was to investigate how GenAI technologies can augment dramaturgical practices by enabling co-creation among authors, performers, and audience members.Using an iterative research-creation methodology, the project unfolded in two phases: a remote prototyping cycle and an on-site laboratory. Across three use cases: generative scenography, physical space extension, and improvised narration—AI tools were integrated into live performance contexts to dynamically respond to human presence and input. Techniques included the use of real-time generative visuals, silhouette-based transformations, and voice-activated storytelling systems.The findings highlight both the creative opportunities and technical constraints of employing GenAI in live performance. Critical insights emerged around timing, audience perception, system orchestration, and the need for adaptable, artist-centric AI workflows. This study emphasizes the potential of GenAI to function not merely as a technical instrument, but as a dramaturgical collaborator in the creation of emotionally resonant, participatory experiences.},

In this study, we documented the Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) learning experience of seven students from two special schools who participated in a series of game design workshops. We analysed their learning process, usage, and perspectives of text-to-image GenAI through video analysis, questionnaire, and evaluation of design outputs. Our findings reveal the students' willingness to learn and utilise AI technology. This AI experience allows students, especially those who struggle with fine motor skills, to translate their ideas into digital images. Moreover, the text-to-image interaction enhances students' ability to convey their ideas in writing and develop their skills in conceptualisation. We also summarised significant human-AI interaction challenges, including difficulties with typing, Chinese and English spelling, and prompt writing. We conclude with recommendations for designing future inclusive human-AI interaction experiences for students with SEN in China.},

However, with the widespread reliance on powerful AI tools for assignment completion, the process has become more convenient. Unfortunately, this ease of use has led to a potential detriment in students' genuine understanding of subjects, as well as a decline in their problem-solving and innovative thinking skills. Moreover, AI tools like ChatGPT will evolve as technology advances such that the need to detect AI-generated content is even more crucial in educational setting to reinforce the value of original work [5]. This paper aims to address this issue by focusing on the detection of plagiarism in student assignments through the utilization of the Copyleaks1 tool, specifically designed to identify AI-generated code. The accuracy of the tool is systematically evaluated by submitting various pairs of codes, each with similar functionality, wherein one is generated by AI and the other by humans.},

Various support options have been offered by search systems over time (e.g., query suggestions, contextual search) to help search engine users more effectively tackle complex tasks. The recent emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and the arrival of assistive agents, or copilots, based on this technology, has the potential to offer further assistance to searchers, especially those engaged in complex tasks.

To this end, we conduct a comprehensive study on the quality assessment of AI-generated 3D human faces.

Based on Gen3DHF, we propose LMME3DHF, a Large Multimodal Model (LMM)-based metric for Evaluating 3DHF capable of quality and authenticity score prediction, distortion-aware visual question answering, and distortion-aware saliency prediction. Experimental results show that LMME3DHF achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods in both accurately predicting quality scores for AI-generated 3D human faces and effectively identifying distortion-aware salient regions and distortion types, while maintaining strong alignment with human perceptual judgments. Both the Gen3DHF database and the LMME3DHF will be released upon the publication.},

With AI/ML technologies being increasingly integrated into young people's lives, there is an urgent need to equip teenagers with AI literacies that build both technical knowledge and awareness of social impacts. Algorithm audits (also called AI audits) have traditionally been employed by experts to assess potential harmful biases, but recent research suggests that non-expert users can also participate productively in auditing. We conducted a two-week participatory design workshop with 14 teenagers (ages 14-15), where they audited the generative AI model behind TikTok's Effect House, a tool for creating interactive TikTok filters. We present a case study describing how teenagers approached the audit, from deciding what to audit to analyzing data using diverse strategies and communicating their results. Our findings show that participants were engaged and creative throughout the activities, independently raising and exploring new considerations, such as age-related biases, that are uncommon in professional audits. We drew on our expertise in algorithm auditing to triangulate their findings as a way to examine if the workshop supported participants to reach coherent conclusions in their audit. Although the resulting number of changes in race, gender, and age representation uncovered by the teens were slightly different from ours, we reached similar conclusions. This study highlights the potential for auditing to inspire learning activities to foster AI literacies, empower teenagers to critically examine AI systems, and contribute fresh perspectives to the study of algorithmic harms.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are the first neural network machines capable of carrying on conversations with humans. They are trained on billions of words of text scraped from the internet. They generate text responses to text inputs. They have transformed the public awareness of artificial intelligence, bringing on reactions ranging from astonishment and awe to trepidation and horror. They have spurred massive investments in new tools for drafting texts, summarizing conversations, summarizing literature, generating images, coding simple programs, supporting education, and amusing humans. Experience with them has shown them likely to respond with fabrications (called "hallucinations") that severely undermine their trustworthiness and make them unsafe for critical applications. Here, we will examine the limitations of LLMs imposed by their design and function. These are not bugs but are inherent limitations of the technology. The same limitations make it unlikely that LLM machines will ever be capable of performing all human tasks at the skill levels of humans.},

  abstract = {This poster reports on the differences in perceptions concerning academic dishonesty and the misuse of resources in college from the perspectives of students, teaching assistants (TAs), and instructors in Computer Science (CS). Dishonesty has been a topic of interest in the CS education community, with efforts addressing how to detect and prevent it [1, 2, 6, 7, 8]. With the presence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and its increased use in recent years, studying all actors’ perspectives on dishonesty in regard to generative AI becomes critical to promote guidelines and strategies for curricular design in CS [4, 5], aligning those who teach and those who learn towards a common ethical ground. This led us to explore the following research questions with a specific emphasis on artificial intelligence in mind:(1)RQ1: How do students, instructors, and teaching assistants respond to scenarios suggesting academic dishonesty in the CS classroom?(2)RQ2: What reasons do students, instructors, and teaching assistants in CS consider may lead someone toward academic dishonesty in the CS classroom?We surveyed 538 undergraduate students, 21 TAs, and six Computer Science (CS) instructors at a large Southeastern U.S. institution. Students and TAs were part of two undergraduate CS courses. Responses were gathered via an online questionnaire that featured 13 multiple-choice questions on whether the participant thought particular situations fell most closely within “serious cheating,” “trivial cheating,” or “no cheating”–questions adapted from the work by Ozment et al. [3]; one open-ended question on the reasons the participant considered why someone might cheat in the CS classroom; and demographic questions. This poster focuses specifically on participants’ responses to the open-ended question, via a thematic analysis to identify recurring categories (i.e., themes) and assess the affinity of participants’ responses within each theme. Subgroups were participants’ demographics and backgrounds.Our findings suggest that all participants have diverse perspectives. Instructors generally referred to "Grade Pressure" and "Laziness" as the top two reasons behind dishonesty, while TAs and students emphasized "Prerequisite Knowledge" and "Time Management" as the main contributing factors. These findings suggest a dichotomy among actors involved in the learning processes happening in the CS classroom.Our work underscores the need for awareness and support strategies in curricular initiatives within the CS Ed community to help prevent dishonesty and promote student success in their computing disciplines. A clear disconnect between instructor expectations and student perceptions encourages clearer communication in the classroom and is a ripe avenue for further study.},

This has significantly increased the number of publications that scope potential changes caused by the application of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in various societal domains. The private use of AI and the economic integration of generative LLMs have increased significantly. However, for parliamentarians and parliamentary professionals, the technology often remains abstract, impacting everyday work only peripherally. Due to the special responsibility of parliaments, governments, and administrations as the organizational instances of society, and through the inherent legitimations by society itself, there is a necessity to examine the implications of the use of generative LLMs within these institutions and traditional structures as well as their influence on political system logic. The article analyzes the responses that the generative LLMs GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 have provided via ChatGPT, based on the same input command (prompt) over different times. The responses help to assess how LLMs can be used in the parliamentary context, to reflect what dangers exist as well as to respond to the question on how a business model of an AI department in parliament might look like. Furthermore, it shall be explored whether there are fluctuations in the quality of the responses and how these should be evaluated against the backdrop of the need for accurate and precise workflows in parliamentary operations. Ultimately, the article aims to provide an answer as to whether the application of ChatGPT together with the LLMs GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 could already deliver this necessary quality and consistency for the parliamentarian working environment today.},

To support these needs, we introduce ReaLJam, an interface and protocol for live musical jamming sessions between a human and a Transformer-based AI agent trained with reinforcement learning. We enable real-time interactions using the concept of anticipation, where the agent continually predicts how the performance will unfold and visually conveys its plan to the user.

However, the limited availability of such datasets remains a key barrier to the development of next-generation video processing solutions. In this paper, we introduce Nature-1k, a large-scale video dataset consisting of 1000 professionally captured 4K Ultra High Definition (UHD) videos, each recorded at 60fps. The dataset covers a wide range of environments, lighting conditions, texture complexities, and motion patterns. To maintain temporal consistency, which is crucial for spatio-temporal learning applications, the dataset avoids scene cuts within the sequences. We further characterize the dataset using established metrics, including spatial and temporal video complexity metrics, as well as colorfulness, brightness, and contrast distribution. Moreover, Nature-1k includes a compressed version to support rapid prototyping and lightweight testing. The quality of the compressed videos is evaluated using four commonly used video quality metrics: PSNR, SSIM, MS-SSIM, and VMAF. Finally, we compare Nature-1k with existing datasets to demonstrate its superior quality and content diversity. The dataset is suitable for a wide range of applications, including Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), video super-resolution and enhancement, video interpolation, as well as video coding, and adaptive video streaming optimization.

  abstract = {The proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced challenges to copyright law, particularly regarding the ability of text-to-image models to replicate distinctive artistic styles. Traditional copyright assessment frameworks struggle with the scale and nuance of AI-generated content, creating a need for systematic, quantifiable approaches to evaluate artistic style similarity. This paper proposes using Siamese Neural Networks (SNNs) to quantify stylistic similarities with relevance to legal substantial similarity assessments in copyright cases. A ResNet-18 based SNN architecture with contrastive loss is employed to capture subtle stylistic elements while differentiating between distinct artistic expressions. The SNN is evaluated using controlled test cases generated by fine-tuned Stable Diffusion models trained on specific artists’ styles and an initial validation of our computational metrics through a human perception study is performed. The proposed SNN-based approach achieves superior discrimination between artistic styles compared to traditional perceptual metrics like Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (mean discrimination scores of 0.156 versus 0.008), with performance variations across artists suggesting sensitivity to distinct styles. The observed correlation between computational similarity scores and human judgments (r=0.728, p=0.001) provides preliminary validation of the alignment of the proposed approach with human perception. This research contributes to the evolving discourse on AI and copyright by establishing quantifiable metrics for artistic style similarity assessment that bridge computational methods with legal frameworks, offering potential pathways toward more systematic copyright evaluation in the age of generative AI.},

  abstract = {Designing effective cybersecurity visualization has become a crucial component of cyber defense strategies in many domains and industrial environments. Human behaviour, modeling and input are major aspects of designing visualization systems. Yet, the task of evaluating these developed visualization systems is both time-consuming and challenging, and it is often prone to cases where user evaluation is limited owing to a lack of different stakeholders and end users during the design process. Recognizing the potential of advanced Generative Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs), our study aims to explore their capabilities in evaluating web-based security visualization tools and dashboards, particularly in the context of smart cities and buildings. We study and compare the feasibility of using various LLMs available today, for conducting usability testing, serving as an additional resource given the limited availability of human participants. In particular, we focus on three different LLMs: Bing Chat, ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-4o. While each had its strengths and drawbacks, our findings revealed that the results obtained had a strong correlation with human test subjects. LLMs can be a valuable aid during evaluation, by offering in-depth insights and evaluations, tailored to the specific requirements of smart buildings, cities and automation cybersecurity. Moreover, our research and findings also reveal that LLMs can similarly be used for the evaluation of a wide range of other visual systems for industrial environments.},

Thus, we raise a specific research question: would an LLM-based system be able to search for relevant GUI layouts? To address this question, we conducted a controlled study evaluating how Instigator, an LLM-based system for searching GUI layouts of web pages by generative pre-trained training, would return GUI layouts that are relevant to a given instruction and what would be the user experience of (N =34) practitioners interacting with Instigator. Our results identify a very high similarity and a moderate correlation between the rankings of the GUI layouts generated by Instigator and the rankings of the practitioners with respect to their relevance to a given design instruction. We highlight the results obtained through thirteen UEQ+ scales that characterize the user experience of the practitioner with Instigator, which we use to discuss perspectives for improving such future tools.},

Qinghai Oilfield has accumulated a large amount of reservoir dynamic analysis data in long-term exploration and development, but the comprehensive use of data and intelligent application is not deep enough, which seriously affects the efficiency of reservoir dynamic analysis. In order to improve the efficiency of reservoir dynamics analysis and decision-making, an intelligent reservoir dynamics analysis platform based on a cloud platform and artificial intelligence analysis methods was established in Qinghai Oilfield. The intelligent reservoir dynamic analysis platform integrates heterogeneous data from multiple sources, establishes scenario-based reservoir dynamic analysis topics, forms a four-level dynamic analysis structure of well-well group-layer-reservoir, and implements functions such as reservoir evaluation indicators calculation, reservoir dynamic early warning analysis, reservoir development parameters optimization, and reservoir development evaluation. Based on this platform, Qinghai Oilfield has achieved the intelligent practice of reservoir dynamic analysis with integrated geological engineering technology. Through the intelligent practice of reservoir dynamic analysis, Qinghai Oilfield has greatly improved the efficiency of reservoir development and production, and the digital and intelligent development has been promoted.},

Under such a background, translation quality evaluation system relying on deep learning has gradually become a hot research topic in the field of translation research. Traditional manual evaluation methods have their own shortcomings, which are relatively subjective and low evaluation efficiency. The existing automatic assessment indicators such as BLEU and METEOR, which have deficiencies in cultural adaptability and logical coherence, cannot meet the complex needs of Sino-French alternating interpretation. This evaluation system combines multi-modal analysis with cross-language and cultural feature database. Based on the improvement of Transformer model architecture, a hierarchical evaluation mechanism is designed, which significantly improves the objectivity of evaluation and makes the evaluation more comprehensive. The experimental results show that this system has more advantages than the traditional method in the three core indicators of accuracy, fluency and cultural adaptability. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the score of this system and the human score reaches 0.87, which proves that it is effective in cross-language and cultural adaptation scenarios. This study provides an extensible technical framework for the assessment of translation quality, and provides innovative solutions to the challenges of linguistic structural differences and cultural metaphor translation.},

  abstract = {Task-oriented chatbots are increasingly used to access all sorts of services – like booking a flight, or setting a medical appointment – through natural language conversation. There are many technologies for implementing task-oriented chatbots, including Dialogflow, Watson, and Rasa. They rely on an explicit definition of the user intents, conversation flows, and chatbot outputs, which is costly to specify, and sometimes results in suboptimal user experiences and artificial conversations with limited diversity of chatbot responses. Recently, the advances in generative artificial intelligence fostered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new range of open-domain chatbots, like ChatGPT, able to converse fluently on any topic. However, they are general-purpose, and therefore not directly usable to solve specialised tasks reliably. In this paper, we study the power of LLMs to build task-oriented chatbots, resulting in lighter specifications – no intent definition required – and more natural conversations than in intent-based approaches. To this end, we propose a lightweight domain-specific language based on YAML to specify chatbots using modules of different types (e.g., menus, question-answering, data gathering). These specifications are compiled into structured LLM prompts that use the ReAct framework to inform our runtime how to interpret the user input and coordinate the tasks that the chatbot must perform. The paper presents the design and realisation of our framework, and an assessment that encodes a set of existing intent-based chatbots using our approach, showing its benefits in terms of specification size, conversation flexibility and output diversity.},

From our experience in CS50, Harvard University's introductory course, we've seen firsthand the impactful role that generative artificial intelligence can play in education. Recognizing its potential and stakes, we integrated OpenAI's GPT into our own teaching methodology. The goal was to emulate a 1:1 teacher-to-student ratio, incorporating "pedagogical guardrails" to maintain instructional integrity. The result was a personalized, AI-powered bot in the form of a friendly rubber duck aimed at delivering instructional responses and troubleshooting without giving outright solutions. In this tutorial, we share our journey and offer insights into responsibly harnessing AI in educational settings. Participants will gain hands-on experience working with GPT through OpenAI's latest APIs, understanding and crafting prompts, answering questions using embedding-based search, and finally, collaboratively building their own AI chatbot. Ultimately, we'll not only share lessons learned from our own approach but also equip educators hands-on with the knowledge and tools with which they, too, can implement these technologies in their unique teaching environments.},

However, research on the practical use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) to address real-world downstream tasks is limited. This study aims to enhance the routine tasks of customer service (CS) representatives, particularly in the finance domain, by applying a fine-tuning method to dialogue summarization in CS centers. KakaoBank handles an average of 15,000 CS calls daily. By employing a fine-tuning method using real-world CS dialogue data, we can reduce the time required to summarize CS dialogues and standardize summarization skills. To ensure effective dialogue summarization in the finance domain, pretrained language models should acquire additional knowledge and skills, such as specific knowledge of financial products, problem-solving abilities, and the capacity to handle emotionally charged customers. In this study, we developed a reference fine-tuned model using Polyglot-Ko (5.8B) as the baseline PLM and a dataset containing a wide range of zero-shot instructions and partially containing summarization instructions. We compared this reference model with another model fine-tuned using KakaoBank’s CS dialogues and summarization data as the instruct dataset. The results demonstrated that the fine-tuned model based on KakaoBank’s internal datasets outperformed the reference model, showing a 199% and 12% improvement in ROUGE-L and RDASS, respectively. This study emphasizes the significance of task-specific fine-tuning using appropriate instruct datasets for effective performance in specific downstream tasks. Considering its practical use, we suggest that fine-tuning using real-world instruct datasets is a powerful and cost-effective technique for developing generative AI in the business domain.},

Specifically, we use a large Olympic athlete dataset and report how variations in the input (e.g., first name and first &amp; last name, with and without country information) impact the accuracy of their predictions. We find that Namsor is the best traditional commercially available tool.

The detection of AI-generated content using the naked eye was perceived to be difficult, hence the need for more accurate, reliable, and effective detection methods. As a countermeasure, educators are turning to AI content detectors and plagiarism checkers to ascertain the originality of submitted school requirements, raising concerns from students regarding the accuracy and reliability of these tools and the ethical implications and negative consequences of misclassification of genuinely original works as machine-generated outputs. By employing a holistic case study approach, the authors attempted to determine the perceptions of selected university students on the use of AI detection systems by faculty members in checking the originality and novelty of their academic outputs. Through the lenses of various normative ethical theories, the authors also analyzed the ethical issues and concerns raised by selected students to better understand their sentiments and the factors they believe could influence the faculty members' intention to adopt this emerging technology. The results of the study revealed that students have mixed attitudes and perceptions toward the faculty's intention to use AI detectors. While students perceived it as a means to encourage independent learning and critical thinking, they also expressed valid concerns regarding fairness, accuracy, and reliability, the impact on teacher-student trust, and the responsible use of the technology, among others. The participants also acknowledged the influence of other faculty members and the students' increasing dependence on AI as possible enablers of technology adoption while technological limitations, the teachers’ lack of technological skills, and age as perceived barriers.

This paper presents the design and development process of Purry, a social robot inspired by cat behaviors, created to provide stress relief for university students. Purry was designed to offer emotional comfort in a unique way, harnessing the calming effects of pet-like interactions. The design process focused on achieving both aesthetic appeal and functional efficiency, combining modern and traditional technologies such as generative artificial intelligence and low-cost materials, following the double diamond methodology. The robot mimics feline behaviors like kneading and purring, exploring both active and passive tactile interactions, which have been shown to reduce stress through sensory stimulation. Iterative development cycles, guided by user feedback, led to significant advancements in balancing form and function. The final result is a robotic experience that combines emotional support with innovative design, offering a product that not only addresses students' mental health needs but also fosters an engaging and comforting presence in their environment.},

In this context, we explore AI as a tool that mediates cultural understanding and remediates human values – that are often influenced by biases and inequities. Using participatory design for learning with a group of 13 children (ages 8-13), we engaged in five co-design sessions featuring different modalities for socio-cultural approaches to AI literacy. We found that children were more aware of the cultural mediation aspect of AI when the content of the interaction aligned with their cultural background and context. This underscored the significance of aligning the representation of culture in these GenAI systems with people’s socio-cultural ecosystems in modern technological literacies. We conclude with design principles for a more critical and holistic approach to AI literacy.},

In contrast, moral rights allow the creators to be acknowledged and to take certain actions to preserve and protect the integrity of their works. Both rights are conventionally granted to human and legal entities. However, the massive advancement of AI challenges the essential presumption that technology is merely a device in the hands of humans in the creation process of Work. This paper examines several legal issues and problems concerning the economic and moral rights of AI-generated works using the juridical normative approach from the perspective of Indonesian Copyright Law. The result shows that the framework of Indonesia's copyright law is based on the principle of human authorship, therefore, moral rights can only be granted to human(s) and economic rights can only be granted to legal subjects acknowledged by Indonesian Law: human and legal entity. Although the authorship and ownership of AI for copyrighted work is contentious under Indonesian Laws, the limited legal personality of AI could potentially artifice as the preventive measures on several problems concerning legal standing by enabling legal subject (human or legal entity) to act behalf of AI to exercise their rights and obligation both based on regulative approach and procedural approach.},

Its application in the field of education has brought about a double-sided effect. On the one hand, AI promotes the great enrichment of material and spiritual wealth and makes it possible to liberate people's hands, which are the basis and conditions for human's freedom and all-round development. On the other hand, AI also brings some hidden worries to education: reshaping people's values, exacerbating the gap in educational resources, and triggering ethical controversies. Based on the Marxist theory on the freedom and comprehensive development of human beings, this paper focuses on the hidden worries of future education under the influence of artificial intelligence to explore the reform paths of future education. The reform paths including establishing correct value concepts to correctly understand the value of education; focusing on independent and diversified learning to cultivate students’ ability of independent critical thinking; breaking down technological barriers to build a technology development platform and share AI technology; sounding ethical rules as well as strengthening institutional regulations and technological protection support to shape the concept of science and technology for good and enhance people's awareness of digital security and self-protection. Promoting future education's reformation in the age of artificial intelligence with correct values, fair educational resources and sound ethical rules can play a good role in educating and cultivating autonomous, diversified and comprehensive new-age talents.},

  abstract = {With the development of generative artificial intelligence, new forgery methods are rapidly emerging. Social platforms are flooded with vast amounts of unlabeled synthetic data and authentic data, making it increasingly challenging to distinguish real from fake. Due to the lack of labels, existing supervised detection methods struggle to effectively address the detection of unknown deepfake methods. Moreover, in open world scenarios, the amount of unlabeled data greatly exceeds that of labeled data. Therefore, we define a new deepfake detection generalization task which focuses on how to achieve efficient detection of large amounts of unlabeled data based on limited labeled data to simulate a open world scenario. To solve the above mentioned task, we propose a novel Open-World Deepfake Detection Generalization Enhancement Training Strategy (OWG-DS) to improve the generalization ability of existing methods. Our approach aims to transfer deepfake detection knowledge from a small amount of labeled source domain data to large-scale unlabeled target domain data. Specifically, we introduce the Domain Distance Optimization (DDO) module to align different domain features by optimizing both inter-domain and intra-domain distances. Additionally, the Similarity-based Class Boundary Separation (SCBS) module is used to enhance the aggregation of similar samples to ensure clearer class boundaries, while an adversarial training mechanism is adopted to learn the domain-invariant features. Extensive experiments show that the proposed deepfake detection generalization enhancement training strategy excels in cross-method and cross-dataset scenarios, improving the model's generalization.},

However, reading proficiency among K-12 students has been declining globally, including in Sweden, leaving many underprepared for post-secondary education. Additionally, an increasing number of students have reading disorders, such as dyslexia, which require support. Generative artificial intelligence (genAI) technologies, like ChatGPT, may offer new opportunities to improve reading practices by enhancing the readability of educational texts. This study investigates whether ChatGPT-4 can simplify academic texts and which prompting strategies are most effective. We tasked ChatGPT to re-write 136 academic texts using four prompting approaches: Standard, Meta, Roleplay, and Chain-of-Thought. All four approaches improved text readability, with Meta performing the best overall and the Standard prompt sometimes creating texts that were less readable than the original. This study found variability in the simplified texts, suggesting that different strategies should be used based on the specific needs of individual learners. Overall, the findings highlight the potential of genAI tools, like ChatGPT, to improve the accessibility of academic texts, offering valuable support for students with reading difficulties and promoting more equitable learning opportunities.},

However, when such navigation aids are unavailable or not appropriately marked up, this situation can cause serious difficulties. This article presents the design and evaluation of a tool for automatically generating navigation aids with headers and internal links for screen readers with topicalisation and labelling algorithms. The proposed tool uses natural language processing techniques to divide a web document into topic segments and label each segment in two cycles based on its content. We conducted an initial user study in the first cycle with eight blind and partially-sighted screen reader users. The evaluation involved tasks with questions answered by participants with information from texts with and without automatically generated headers. The results in the first cycle provided preliminary indicators of performance improvement and cognitive load reduction. The second cycle involved co-designing an improved version with two blind experts in web accessibility, resulting in a browser extension which injects automatically generated headers and in-page navigation with internal links, along with improvements in the generation of labels using OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The browser extension was evaluated by seven blind participants using the same four texts used to evaluate the preliminary prototype developed in the first cycle. With the two development cycles, the study provided important insights into the design of navigation aids for screen-reader users using natural language processing techniques, including the potential use of generative artificial intelligence for assistive technologies and limitations that need to be explored in future research.},

Statistics from the students' learning history and behavioural data are used with deep learning for the prediction of students' learning needs accurate enough to recommend personalised resources. Students' progress in understanding is checked through natural language processing before further personalisation. The complexity of the learning content then changes dynamically in accordance to every individual. The tasks of collecting data, training the proposed model, optimising its algorithm, and validating the experiments therein are undertaken. The experiments find that the performance of student learning using the hybrid model improved by 9.3%, reduced learning time by 15.5%, and improved finding the right recommendation by about 23.8% compared to the non-intelligent platform. In conclusion, the study proves that Ai and open learning, in practice, can increase the efficiency of learning and enhance the learning experience, providing a way to bridge the equity in education with personalised education.},

  abstract = {Voting advice applications (VAAs) are pivotal web-based tools that guide citizens to align with political parties and candidates that match their preferences. Traditional methods for creating candidate profiles predominantly rely on questionnaire responses, a time-intensive and costly process. To address these challenges, we introduce a data-centric methodology utilizing generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), culminating in creating political avatars. These political avatars are engineered using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4 and Bard. They are adept at processing and interpreting data primarily sourced from Twitter and leveraging bespoke, self-trained datasets. Integrating advanced AI technology with diverse data sources equips political avatars with unprecedented analytical and predictive capabilities, setting a new standard in political analysis. Unlike traditional methods, political avatars are adept at emulating the responses of real politicians or experts, showcasing a remarkable capacity to interact with VAA surveys. This novel approach presents the potential to either compete with or enhance the insights traditionally obtained from human experts. Another critical aspect of our study is comparing political avatars and previous research employing question-answering (QA) models based on advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques for political profiling. This comparative analysis reveals that Political Avatars offer a significantly more robust solution for profile construction. While QA models provide structured responses based on specific queries, political avatars bring an element of dynamism and depth, capable of generating nuanced, context-aware responses. This shift from static, questionnaire-based profiling to dynamic, AI-driven avatars marks a substantial leap in political analysis. Generative AI in crafting Political Avatars introduces a transformative element to data analysis. This approach facilitates a layered and more sophisticated interpretation of political stances, moving beyond the limitations of traditional profiling methods. By employing political avatars, our methodology not only streamlines the profiling process but also enriches the quality of insights derived, paving the way for a more nuanced understanding of the political landscape.},

To address this, we introduce a generative content replacement (GCR) method in image privacy protection, which seamlessly substitutes privacy-threatening contents with similar and realistic substitutes, using state-of-the-art generative techniques. Compared with four prevalent image protection methods, GCR consistently exhibited low detectability, making the detection of edits remarkably challenging. GCR also performed reasonably well in hindering the identification of specific content and managed to sustain the image’s narrative and visual harmony. This research serves as a pilot study and encourages further innovation on GCR and the development of tools that enable human-in-the-loop image privacy protection using approaches similar to GCR.},

  abstract = {Has AI surpassed humans in creative idea generation? This question has gained traction as generative AI (GenAI) has become widely used to support creativity. To evaluate this, we examined the first wave of experimental studies comparing human and GenAI-prompted creative idea generation by conducting a meta-analysis of 17 studies comprising 115 effect sizes. The results showed a small but non-significant pooled effect favoring GenAI. Initial analyses suggested greater originality in GenAI ideas, but sensitivity analysis showed this was driven by a few studies with very large effects. No significant differences were found between human ideas and those generated by prompting specific GenAI models (GPT-3, GPT-3.5, GPT-4). Funnel plots and asymmetry tests indicated no evidence of publication bias, supporting the findings’ validity. This meta-analysis finds no empirical support suggesting that GenAI has surpassed humans in creative idea generation. We discuss sociotechnical and sociocultural approaches as crucial for shaping human and artificial creativity.},

The results of research show that AI technologies have significantly increased the experience for people with hearing impairments, visual impairments, mobility limitations and intellectual disabilities visiting the museum. These technologies create more equal sharing in Science Education by personalizing and letting these process interactively. Intelligent audio-guidance systems, image who recognised technology and tactile models are all specific applications were designed to make a more accessible environment for visitors with disabilities. Nevertheless, data privacy breaches and inequities during the technology deployment should be effectively addressed. Future research should explore how one may balance technological innovation with risk management with respect to making AI safe and reliable to augment accessibility of all people living with disabilities.},

Many well-known universities in China have stepped up their pace and actively explored the deep integration of "artificial intelligence + education". A series of innovative practices, such as intelligent teaching system, intelligent classroom, virtual teaching assistant and personalized learning platform, all show that the education industry is undergoing an unprecedented intelligent transformation. But at the same time, the application of artificial intelligence in the teaching process in colleges and universities is not mature, and there are still many problems. In this context, it has become very urgent to explore how to efficiently use artificial intelligence technology to contribute to the higher education in China. This paper introduces the development process of AI and its application in colleges and universities, then analyzes the obstacles of AI when applied in higher education, and finally proposes specific application strategies for artificial intelligence to empower new teaching and learning models in universities. It is hoped that the research of this paper can improve the application of artificial intelligence in the teaching of universities in China.},

  abstract = {Teaching computer science at scale can be challenging. From our experience in CS50, Harvard University's introductory course, we've seen firsthand the impactful role that generative artificial intelligence can play in education. Recognizing its potential and stakes, we integrated OpenAI's GPT into our own teaching methodology. The goal was to emulate a 1:1 teacher-to-student ratio, incorporating "pedagogical guardrails" to maintain instructional integrity. The result was a personalized, AI-powered bot in the form of a friendly rubber duck aimed at delivering instructional responses and troubleshooting without giving outright solutions. We plan to share our journey and offer insights into responsibly harnessing AI in educational settings. Participants will gain hands-on experience working with GPT through OpenAI's APIs, understanding and crafting prompts, answering questions using embedding-based search, and finally, building their own AI chatbot. Ultimately, we'll not only share lessons learned from our own approach but also equip educators hands-on with the knowledge and tools with which they, too, can implement these technologies in their unique teaching environments.},

  abstract = {Flow-guided Localization (FGL) enables the identification of spatial regions within the human body that contain an event of diagnostic interest. FGL does that by leveraging the passive movement of energy-constrained nanodevices circulating through the bloodstream. Existing FGL solutions rely on graph models with fixed topologies or handcrafted features, which limit their adaptability to anatomical variability and hinder scalability. In this work, we explore the use of Set Transformer architectures to address these limitations. Our formulation treats nanodevices' circulation time reports as unordered sets, enabling permutation-invariant, variable-length input processing without relying on spatial priors. To improve robustness under data scarcity and class imbalance, we integrate synthetic data generation via deep generative models, including CGAN, WGAN, WGAN-GP, and CVAE. These models are trained to replicate realistic circulation time distributions conditioned on vascular region labels, and are used to augment the training data. Our results show that the Set Transformer achieves comparable classification accuracy compared to Graph Neural Networks (GNN) baselines, while simultaneously providing by-design improved generalization to anatomical variability. The findings highlight the potential of permutation-invariant models and synthetic augmentation for robust and scalable nanoscale localization.},

  abstract = {When working with generative artificial intelligence (AI), users may see productivity gains, but content generated with the help of AI may not match their preferences exactly. The boost in productivity may come at the expense of users' idiosyncrasies, such as personal style and tastes, preferences we would naturally express without AI. To let users express their preferences, many AI systems let users edit their prompt (e.g., Midjourney) or allow more natural interactions (e.g., ChatGPT), and users can always review and edit the AI-generated output themselves. However, aligning a user's intentions with an AI's output can take time and may not always be worth it if the AI's first or default output "does the job." In short, users face a trade-off between AI output fidelity and communication cost. The purpose of this work is to examine the impact of this human-AI interaction on the AI-generated content we produce as a society.We propose a Bayesian model to study the societal consequences of human-AI interactions. For a given task, rational users can exchange information with the AI to align its output with their heterogeneous preferences. The AI has a knowledge of the distribution of preferences in the population and uses a Bayesian update to create the optimal output with maximal expected fidelity given the information shared by the user. Users choose the amount of information they share to maximize their utility, balancing the cost of communication with the fidelity of the output.We show that the interplay between individual users and AI may lead to societal challenges. Outputs may become more homogenized. The AI-generated output distribution has a lower variance than the users' preference distribution. And this phenomenon is exacerbated when AI-generated content is used to train the next generation of AI: we show numerically that the users' rational decisions and the AI's training process can mutually reinforce each other, leading to a homogenization "death spiral." We also study the effects of AI bias, identifying who benefits or loses when using an AI model that does not accurately reflect the population preference distribution. At the population level, the censoring type of bias (e.g., biasing against the more unique preferences) negatively impacts the population utility as a whole, especially users with uncommon preferences who rely on AI interactivity the most. On the other hand, directional biases (e.g., a slightly left-leaning AI) will influence the users' chosen output, leading to a societal bias. Nonetheless, our research also demonstrates that creating models that facilitate human-AI interactions can limit these risks and preserve the population preference diversity.A full version of this paper can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10448.},

  abstract = {Manual verification has become very challenging based on the increasing volume of information shared online and the role of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). Thus, AI systems are used to identify disinformation and deep fakes online. Previous research has shown that superior performance can be observed when combining AI and human expertise. Moreover, according to the EU AI Act, human oversight is inevitable when using AI systems in a domain where fundamental human rights, such as the right to free expression, might be affected. Thus, AI systems need to be transparent and offer sufficient explanations to be comprehensible. Much research has been done on integrating eXplainability (XAI) features to increase the transparency of AI systems; however, they lack human-centered evaluation. Additionally, the meaningfulness of explanations varies depending on users’ background knowledge and individual factors. Thus, this research implements a human-centered evaluation schema to evaluate different XAI features for the collaborative human-AI disinformation detection task. Hereby, objective and subjective evaluation dimensions, such as performance, perceived usefulness, understandability, and trust in the AI system, are used to evaluate different XAI features. A user study was conducted with an overall total of 433 participants, whereas 406 crowdworkers and 27 journalists participated as experts in detecting disinformation. The results show that free-text explanations contribute to improving non-expert performance but do not influence the performance of experts. The XAI features increase the perceived usefulness, understandability, and trust in the AI system, but they can also lead crowdworkers to blindly trust the AI system when its predictions are wrong.},

Rather than treating such misalignments as failures to be corrected, this paper reframes them as sources of creative ambiguity and cognitive tension. Drawing on theories of cognitive dissonance, frame conflict, and prediction error, I show how these tensions can catalyze reflection, reinterpretation, and creative reframing. Through five cross-modal cases spanning writing, design, music, code, and prototyping I demonstrate how creative ambiguity and cognitive tension function as generative forces in human–AI interaction.

  abstract = {Formal communications such as public calls, announcements, or regulations are supposed to exhibit respect for diversity in terms of gender, race, age, and disability. However, human writers often lack adequate inclusive writing skills. For instance, they tend to overuse the masculine as a neutral form, mainly because they are self-trained on biased text examples. To overcome this issue, we propose to leverage Generative Artificial Intelligence to support inclusive language writing. Focusing on formal Italian communications, we have designed and developed an AI-assisted tool for non-inclusive text detection and reformulation. Thanks to the joint work with a team of linguistic experts, we first define a set of linguistic criteria necessary to model inclusive writing forms in Italian. Based on these criteria, we collect and annotate a dataset of Italian administrative documents enriched with fine-grained inclusive annotations. Finally, we train deep learning models on the collected data for non-inclusive language detection and inclusive language reformulation tasks. We perform quantitative and human-driven evaluations on the trained models. The best detection model correctly classifies 89% of the sentences, whereas the best reformulation model produces 73% fully correct reformulations. Both models have been integrated into a writing assistance tool acting as a text proofreader and self-learning tool for non-expert writers, namely Inclusively. Once a non-inclusive piece of text is detected, the proposed approach suggests inclusive reformulations. The tool also provides explanations of the models’ outputs to increase system transparency. Furthermore, it allows expert end-users to provide further annotations for system fine-tuning. The trained models and the writing assistance tool are publicly available for research purposes.},

However, generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) brings additional design considerations and currently lacks sufficient user guidance regarding affordances, inputs, and outputs. In this context, we developed a recommender system to promote responsible AI (RAI) practices while people prompt GenAI systems, by recommending addition of sentences based on social values and removal of harmful sentences. We detail a lightweight recommender system designed to be used in prompting-time and compare its recommendations to the ones provided by three base large language models (LLMs) and two LLMs fine-tuned for the task, i.e., recommending inclusion of sentences based on social values and removal of harmful sentences from a given prompt. Results indicate that our approach has the best F1-score balance in terms of recommendations for additions and removal of sentences to promote responsible prompts, while a fine-tuned model obtained the best F1-score for additions, and our approach obtained the best F1-score for removals of harmful sentences. In addition, fine-tuned models improved the objectiveness of responses by reducing the verbosity of generated content in 93% when compared to the content generated by base models. Presented findings contribute to RAI by showing the limits and bias of existing LLMs in terms of recommendations on how to create more responsible prompts and how open-source technologies can fill this gap in prompting-time.},

  abstract = {Tasks are central to information retrieval (IR) and drive interactions with search systems [2, 4, 10]. Understanding and modeling tasks helps these systems better support user needs [8, 9, 11]. This keynote focuses on search tasks, the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI), and the implications of recent work at their intersection for the future of search. Recent estimates suggest that half of Web search queries go unanswered, many of them connected to complex search tasks that are ill-defined or multi-step and span several queries[6]. AI copilots, e.g., ChatGPT and Bing Chat, are emerging to address complex search tasks and many other challenges. These copilots are built on large foundation models such as GPT-4 and are being extended with skills and plugins. Copilots broaden the surface of tasks achievable via search, moving toward creation not just finding (e.g., interview preparation, email composition), and can make searchers more efficient and more successful.Users currently engage with AI copilots via natural language queries and dialog and the copilots generate answers with source attribution [7]. However, in delegating responsibility for answer generation, searchers also lose some control over aspects of the search process, such as directly manipulating queries and examining lists of search results [1]. The efficiency gains from auto-generating a single, synthesized answer may also reduce opportunities for user learning and serendipity. A wholesale move to copilots for all search tasks is neither practical nor necessary: model inference is expensive, conversational interfaces are unfamiliar to many users in a search context, and traditional search already excels for many types of task. Instead, experiences that unite search and chat are becoming more common, enabling users to adjust the modality and other aspects (e.g., answer tone) based on the task.The rise of AI copilots creates many opportunities for IR, including aligning generated answers with user intent, tasks, and applications via human feedback [3]; understanding copilot usage, including functional fixedness [5]; using context and data to tailor responses to people and situations (e.g., grounding, personalization); new search experiences (e.g., unifying search and chat); reliability and safety (e.g., accuracy, bias); understanding impacts on user learning and agency; and evaluation (e.g., model-based feedback, searcher simulations [12] repeatability). Research in these and related areas will enable search systems to more effectively utilize new copilot technologies together with traditional search to help searchers better tackle a wider variety of tasks.},

It addresses real-world problems and drives the learning process through collaborative exploration and iterative thinking among students. It shifts the educational goal from rote memorization of knowledge to the generation and development of abilities. However, PBL still faces many challenges in teaching implementation, mainly including three aspects: personalized project design, dynamic process guidance, and refined evaluation feedback. With the acceleration of digital transformation in education and the development of Large Scale Models technology, applying Generative AI to PBL will provide assistance for its effective implementation. Generative AI can assist in optimizing teaching project design, support personalized exploration processes for students, and achieve multi-dimensional ability assessment of students. At present, the application of Generative AI in PBL is in the exploratory stage. This article deconstructs the application of Generative AI in project design, implementation, and evaluation. Then, taking the exchange network construction teaching project as an example, it proposes the prompt language design of Generative AI in PBL teaching project design.

Although so many studies attempt to explore the matching of the possibility of this growing technology with the higher education system, ample research needs to be conducted to solve the challenges facing the renovation of higher education. With this in mind, our aim of bibliometric studies is to conduct a deep investigation into the increasingly developing scenario of Generative AI tools in higher education. We extracted data from the Web of Science database that is up-to-date till July 2024, comprising 934 relevant articles. Co-citation and co-word analyses revealed three main research clusters: advanced computationable methods, AI application in higher education, and user technology and adoption. The findings illustrated rapid diffusion of generative AI technologies with prominent emphasis on large-language models in pedagogical practices. Other critical themes center around developing AI-facilitated learning interventions, ethical challenges, and usage impact on learning outcomes. The results show that the field is inherently interdisciplinary, using ideas from educational technology, cognitive science, and AI. In addition, a rising trend is noted for the focus on academic honesty and users' involvement with AI devices. The results indicate the important implications of this study for teachers and policymakers alongside contributions to teaching and research that offer a guide to sustainable improvement across education. Future research would benefit from longitudinal studies drawing on an interdisciplinary approach to realize the long-term implications and address complex issues surrounding the integration of AI within universities.},

As generative AI applications become increasingly powerful and ubiquitous, the way we instruct and interact with them through prompts has profound implications for fairness, accountability, and transparency. It is, therefore, necessary to examine how strategic prompt engineering can embed ethical and legal considerations and societal values directly into AI interactions, moving beyond mere technical optimization for functionality. This article proposes “Reflexive Prompt Engineering”, a comprehensive framework for responsible prompt engineering that encompasses five interconnected components: prompt design, system selection, system configuration, performance evaluation, and prompt management. Drawing from empirical evidence, the paper demonstrates how each component can be leveraged to promote improved societal outcomes while mitigating potential risks. The analysis reveals that effective prompt engineering requires a delicate balance between technical precision and ethical consciousness, combining the systematic rigor and focus on functionality with the nuanced understanding of social impact. Through examination of emerging practices, this article illustrates how responsible prompt engineering serves as a crucial connection between AI development and deployment, enabling organizations to align AI outputs without modifying underlying model architectures. This approach links with broader “Responsibility by Design” principles, embedding ethical considerations directly into the implementation process rather than treating them as post-hoc additions. The article concludes by identifying key research directions and practical guidelines for advancing the field of responsible prompt engineering as an essential component of AI literacy.},

  abstract = {The remarkable advancement of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has driven revolutionary applications for text-to-image generation, like Stable Diffusion and Imagen. Especially, the diffusion model can generate stunning images from natural language descriptions by using a reverse continuous denoising process. However, the computation burden of diffusion model-based GenAI services poses a significant hurdle for their practical implementation. In this work, we propose a novel edge computing-assisted GenAI framework to enable efficient GenAI service provision, where the intermediate output generated by diffusion models can be cached on edge servers and reused by various users to improve edge computing resource utilization. Assuming the existence of causally correlated auxiliary information, a long-term caching problem is formulated under intra-time-slot caching constraints by considering various maximally reusable steps of diffusion model-based GenAI tasks and the available caching capacity at edge servers. By leveraging the Lyapunov optimization framework, we transform the time-average caching problem into several deterministic problems for different time slots. We develop a deep reinforcement learning-based caching (DRC) algorithm to obtain caching decisions in each time slot, where a deep neural network (DNN)-based caching action generation module and a model-based evaluation module are designed. Finally, we conduct extensive simulation experiments by comparing the DRC algorithm with benchmark algorithms. The simulation results depict that the proposed DRC algorithm can reduce response time and improve cache hit rates significantly. The code is available at https://gitee.com/pipihinsky/DRC.},

  abstract = {This study delves into the impact of artificial intelligence on students’ learning.The paper pioneers the use of k-means classification to reduce the dimensionality of features before the classification process, which minimizes redundant information and computational overhead. This step is not commonly found in prior research.Firstly, a random forest model is established with “whether AI assistance was used to complete the paper” as the output, and various features as inputs. The analysis of the predictive accuracy when changing input features reveals the degree of influence of each feature on using AI to complete the paper. After feature selection, the remaining 6 features can still effectively predict the use of AI to complete the paper, indicating the representativeness of the extracted indicators. Subsequently, the PCA-K-means algorithm is employed to classify the use of artificial intelligence. PCA algorithm is used for dimensionality reduction of the extracted features to better characterize students’ use of AI. Three representative variables are selected, and the contribution of each feature is computed based on the factor loading matrix. Finally, the K-means algorithm is used to classify students based on the three-dimensional features, showing that students can be effectively classified into 2 categories. The results indicate that the majority of students support the use of AI technology to enhance their abilities, although some students may only intend to use AI to cope with exams and similar tasks.},

The conference was created by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), inspired by the emergence of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and the accompanying shift in thinking about education. Over the years, the conference has evolved and is now one of the most relevant venues for discussion of the highest quality research on how learning and teaching can be transformed by technology.The aim of L@S is to address real-world educational challenges and simultaneously contribute to a fundamental understanding of human learning. Together, our goal is to investigate how data and technology can be leveraged to create more responsible and effective learning experiences for all learners across the globe. The theme of L@S 2025 is Learning Synergies @ Scale. As technology continues to reshape education, at the L@S 2025 conference we explore how generative artificial intelligence (AI) and its new possibilities can be leveraged to better support learning across the lifespan. L@S 2025 explores the impact of AI on learning with an emphasis on scalability and the broader impact of technological advances in learning environments. As a community we address the challenges of applying scalable, technology-driven solutions in both structured institutional environments and dynamic, self-directed learning communities, especially those that provide actionable insights for equitable and effective adaptive learning experiences. Creating synergies between research and practice, and contributing to breaking down barriers between the two, we present research co-informed by practice at scale.},

  abstract = {The continuous advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) enable designers to efficiently obtain vast amounts of inspirational materials during the design conception phase. Various modalities of stimuli can impact designers’ creativity. However, the relationship between the sequence of different modalities (Text, Images, and Virtual Models) and creativity remains to be explored. In this study, we investigate the effects of 6 sequential combinations of 3 modalities on designers’ creativity. Designers (N=36) used the creative stimulation platform InspireMe, accessing inspirational stimuli in various sequences to execute their design tasks. We analyzed the impact on creativity through assessments of work innovation and user interviews. The findings indicate that the sequence of material combinations significantly influences designers’ creativity, with varying impacts on the different sub-attributes of creativity. Drawing on experimental findings and qualitative research, this paper introduces a creativity demand-matching inspirational stimulation interaction strategy—the CDI strategy—that assists designers in developing more targeted design solutions. Furthermore, we propose the 3C Framework, a design strategy for creativity stimulation platforms aimed at designers in the intelligent era. This framework aims to guide the development of creative stimulation platforms for designers in the intelligent era.},

  abstract = {Concrete is the most widely used engineered material in the world with more than 10 billion tons produced annually. Unfortunately, with that scale comes a significant burden in terms of energy, water, and release of greenhouse gases and other pollutants; indeed 8% of worldwide carbon emissions are attributed to the production of cement, a key ingredient in concrete. As such, there is interest in creating concrete formulas that minimize this environmental burden, while satisfying engineering performance requirements including compressive strength. Specifically for computing, concrete is a major ingredient in the construction of data centers. In this work, we use conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs), a type of semi-supervised generative artificial intelligence (AI) model, to discover concrete formulas with desired properties. Our model is trained just using a small open dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository joined with environmental impact data from standard lifecycle analysis. Computational predictions demonstrate CVAEs can design concrete formulas with much lower carbon requirements than existing formulations while meeting design requirements. Next we report laboratory-based compressive strength experiments for five AI-generated formulations, which demonstrate that the formulations exceed design requirements. The resulting formulations were then used by Ozinga Ready Mix—a concrete supplier—to generate field-ready concrete formulations, based on local conditions and their expertise in concrete design. Finally, we report on how these formulations were used in the construction of buildings and structures in a Meta data center in DeKalb, IL, USA. Results from field experiments as part of this real-world deployment corroborate the efficacy of AI-generated low-carbon concrete mixes.},

  abstract = {The progress in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has fueled AI-powered tools like co-pilots and assistants to provision better guidance, particularly during data analysis. However, research on guidance has not yet examined the perceived efficacy of the source from which guidance is offered and the impact of this source on the user’s perception and usage of guidance. We ask whether users perceive all guidance sources as equal, with particular interest in three sources: (i) “AI,” (ii) “human expert,” and (iii) “a group of human analysts.” As a benchmark, we consider a fourth source, (iv) “unattributed guidance,” where guidance is provided without attribution to any source, enabling isolation of and comparison with the effects of source-specific guidance. We design a five-condition between-subjects study, with one condition for each of the four guidance sources and an additional (v) “no-guidance” condition, which serves as a baseline to evaluate the influence of any kind of guidance. We situate our study in a custom data preparation and analysis tool wherein we task users to select relevant attributes from an unfamiliar dataset to inform a business report. Depending on the assigned condition, users can request guidance, which the system then provides in the form of attribute suggestions. To ensure internal validity, we control for the quality of guidance across source-conditions. Through several metrics of usage and perception, we statistically test five preregistered hypotheses and report on additional analysis. We find that the source of guidance matters to users, but not in a manner that matches received wisdom. For instance, users utilize guidance differently at various stages of analysis, including expressing varying levels of regret, despite receiving guidance of similar quality. Notably, users in the AI condition reported both higher post-task benefit and regret. These findings strongly indicate the need to further understand how different guidance sources impact user behavior for designing effective guidance systems.},

Traditional design education in schools invests considerable time in cultivating students' basic skills in using techniques, tools, materials, etc., but overlooks the wave which has been brought by artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence has surpassed human performance in specific fields and is poised to replace the work of many laborers. As artificial intelligence technology advances, its applications will permeate more areas, including thinking and creative abilities that humans have taken pride in. Design education in universities should re-examine the design values of human designers and artificial intelligence respectively. This redefinition of values implies that the abilities required of designers need to be reframed. Design education in universities should also explore how to integrate artificial intelligence-related technologies into current design curricula. New design courses must manifest the value of human designers. Furthermore, design programs offered by universities should begin planning training courses on collaborative design with artificial intelligence and establish relevant mechanisms for making artificial intelligence an effective tool to assist designers. In addition to redefining the value of designers and planning artificial intelligence-assisted design courses, design departments should monitor industry trends and gather year-by-year feedback to provide students with up-to-date career development advice. We should recognize the crisis that artificial intelligence presents to current design education and address the impact of this wave on design students. Artificial intelligence is progressing toward an irreversible trend, and the growth and transformation of designers will become a new challenge for future design education.},

  abstract = {The emergence of generative and procedural art marks a fundamental shift in creative practice, where the traditional “art-object” (painting, sculpture…) transforms into an “art-subject” paradigm that challenges temporal assumptions about design and futurity. As computational systems evolve beyond mere extensions of human memory and processing capacity, they demonstrate a unique form of creativity that can be characterized as “imachination”—a term that captures the machine’s distinctive approach to creative synthesis, which parallels yet diverges from normative human imagination.This transformation necessitates a reconceptualization of artistic skills and creative agency. While traditional artistic mastery centered on manual dexterity and technical craftsmanship (tekhn\`{e} vs tekhn\`{e}), contemporary practice reveals that manual execution may have restricted the creative process to a temporally and spatially contained form or reification. We may consider that, until the 19th century, the art-object has restrained the canonic practice to using hands as a constraint imposed by the inability to directly project mental concepts through the eyes. Assuming with Leonardo that “la pittura\`{e} cosa mentale”, the art-object translates into the interruption, at a highly specific moment of the mental process putting a full stop to its dynamic expression. Temporality becomes a good way to understand the outcomes of generative media. While the traditional practice focusses on the trace left by the brush stroke or the chisel print in marble, the evidence of “what happened” frozen in time (Roland Barthes’ “\c{C}a a\'{e}t\'{e}” (in La chambre claire), reversely, generative and processual artworks are designed for “what they will come”. Metaphorically we could say that one is the hundred millions years old petrified tree, the other is the seed of promises, thoroughly designed by the artist to open up fields of virtuality. The temporal switch is striking and it doesn’t affect only the artwork, but also the artist forced to reconsider one’s practice.The advent of collective (Pierre Levy) and connective (Derrick de Kerckhove) intelligence introduces creativity models based on unlimited repositories of historical references. This creates a fundamental paradox: we expect creativity to forge new pathways while simultaneously grounding it in comprehensive analysis of existing patterns. The limitations of traditional IQ-based assessments of logical-mathematical intelligence become apparent in this context, neurotypical thinking is a highly normative conception of human thought, and neurodivergent thinking patterns—characterized by rapid, non-linear connections across conceptual spaces—may provide more accurate models for understanding how imachination operates.During this talk, I will present original case studies exploring the conceptual territory of human-machine creative interweaving. Through the definition of conceptual building blocks such as iterative curatorship, egonomy, extended serendipity, critical fusion, artificial intentionality, and maieutic engines, this essay shed light on how human creative role will evolve, not competing with artificial intelligence, but through new forms of human-machine symbiosis that expand the boundaries of creative possibilities, while presenting to the human kind a magic mirror to see its true colors.The investigation draws upon the ancient concept of clinamen–the random disruption of the flow of particles that generates diversity in atomic systems–as a metaphor for understanding how creative divergence functions in both human neurodivergence and artificial intelligence systems. By following these “lines of steepest slope” through the latent spaces of machine learning, we can better comprehend the emerging landscape of augmented creativity and its implications for future artistic practice.},

  abstract = {The process of fashion design usually involves sketching, refining, and coloring, with designers drawing inspiration from various images to fuel their creative endeavors. However, conventional image search methods often yield irrelevant results, impeding the design process. Moreover, creating and coloring sketches can be time-consuming and demanding, acting as a bottleneck in the design workflow. In this work, we introduce HAIGEN (Human-AI Collaboration for GENeration), an efficient fashion design system for Human-AI collaboration developed to aid designers. Specifically, HAIGEN consists of four modules. T2IM, located in the cloud, generates reference inspiration images directly from text prompts. With three other modules situated locally, the I2SM batch generates the image material library into a certain designer-style sketch material library. The SRM recommends similar sketches in the generated library to designers for further refinement, and the STM colors the refined sketch according to the styles of inspiration images. Through our system, any designer can perform local personalized fine-tuning and leverage the powerful generation capabilities of large models in the cloud, streamlining the entire design development process. Given that our approach integrates both cloud and local model deployment schemes, it effectively safeguards design privacy by avoiding the need to upload personalized data from local designers. We validated the effectiveness of each module through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments. User surveys also confirmed that HAIGEN offers significant advantages in design efficiency, positioning it as a new generation of aid-tool for designers.},

  abstract = {With the continuous advancement of artificial intelligence technology, the automatic generation of educational content has become an important tool to improve teaching efficiency and achieve personalized learning. However, there are still problems in evaluating the quality of generated content: monotonous evaluation dimensions and lack of dynamic adaptability; In this paper, an intelligent assessment method based on AI is proposed. Firstly, a multi-dimensional evaluation framework covering knowledge accuracy, logic correctness, teaching objectives, fitness, and learner adaptability is designed. Then, by combining pre-trained language models and GAN technology, an efficient and accurate assessment model is constructed. A learner feedback mechanism was introduced to optimize dynamic adaptability; The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper outperforms existing methods on both the public data set and the self-built data set, especially in knowledge accuracy and learner adaptation. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper outperforms existing methods on public and self-built data sets, especially in knowledge accuracy and learner adaptation, verifying its wide applicability in real-world situations, providing a good evaluation tool for automatically generating teaching materials, and laying a technical foundation for the deeper application of artificial intelligence in education fields.},

  abstract = {Generative AI has emerged as a transformative technology capable of reshaping public sector operations by streamlining administrative tasks, enhancing data analytics, and driving more personalized citizen interactions. Despite its potential, a critical gap remains in understanding how generative AI can be effectively integrated into government processes, particularly in developing countries like Indonesia, where bureaucratic inefficiencies and infrastructural constraints persist. This study addresses this gap by conducting a mixed-method investigation that combines a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of generative AI applications across multiple sectors to inform public service innovation, with expert interviews from key stakeholders Indonesian government, academic, and industry. The findings indicate that generative AI holds substantial promise for reducing manual processes, improving inter-agency coordination, and fostering data-driven decision-making. However, challenges related to ethical considerations, data privacy, and limited digital infrastructure present significant barriers to widespread adoption. By proposing a governance framework and offering strategic recommendations tailored to the Indonesian context, this research provides actionable insights for policymakers, government agencies, and technology providers. In doing so, it contributes to the evolving discourse on AI-driven public service innovation and offers a pathway toward realizing a more efficient and citizen-focused smart government in Indonesia.},

  abstract = {With the development of artificial intelligence technology, generative AI models such as GPT are now increasingly used in education. Studies have found that these models have great potential in improving students' innovation ability, especially in cultivating students' creative thinking and problem-solving abilities. However, we found that the current traditional teaching methods are still somewhat lacking in cultivating students' innovation and creativity. For example, many students are not well prepared and answer questions when facing complex real-life problems. This time, our research mainly wants to see whether the tasks designed based on GPT can effectively improve undergraduate students' creativity. At the same time, we use the support vector machine (SVM) model for quantitative evaluation. We designed four specific tasks to examine students' performance from the core dimensions of innovation, namely creative thinking, problem solving, knowledge integration, and teamwork. The experimental results show that GPT has a significant effect on improving students' creative thinking (task one) and problem solving (task two), especially in the problem-solving task. We also compared the scores predicted by the model with the actual scores and found that the two were very consistent, which shows that GPT can indeed help students better diverge their thinking and analyze problems. In addition, this study also verified the feasibility of using support vector machines to quantitatively evaluate students' innovation ability. In general, GPT combined with machine learning models such as SVM may become a valuable tool in the future in improving students' creativity, problem-solving ability, and even overall innovation performance.},

By analyzing the demands of teachers and students, a resource optimization model centered on the trinity collaboration of "teacher - GenAI - student" is proposed. Teaching resources are scientifically divided, and a four-step dynamic process of "data collection - demand transformation - resource generation - application iteration" is designed. Taking the "Obstacle Avoidance Design of Intelligent Logistics Robots" project of the Python course in higher vocational education as a case for practical verification, the results show that students' mastery rate of sensor principles, code debugging efficiency, and ability of cross-scenario knowledge transfer have all improved. This model has achieved the transformation of teaching resources from supply-driven to demand-led by precisely matching the needs of teachers and students and dynamically optimizing the supply of resources, providing theoretical support and practical paths for the construction of the human-machine collaborative education ecosystem.},

In the current medical field, it is widely used in image recognition to diagnose patient symptoms, train clinical prediction models, and improve clinical workflow processes to avoid missing treatment opportunities. These methods have all achieved good results so far. Now, generative AI is also impacting the development of the medical field, not only generating prescriptions that match patient conditions but also being applied in generating medical images for data augmentation and simulating various pathological conditions, thereby aiding in training deep learning models. Stroke is a leading cause of death or disability, ranking as the second leading cause of death worldwide, next to cancer. If cancers were categorized individually, stroke would surpass all single diseases, making it a primary focus of research in brain disease treatment. There are already studies where generative AI has been used to create medical images, which are then manually evaluated by doctors to determine if they were generated by AI. In this project, we plan to generate CT images of strokes using generative AI and use a trained model (to diagnose stroke) to improve accuracy. Through this project, we hope to solve the problem of scarce stroke CT images while also providing support for training stroke-related models.},

Poetry is no exception, as even general-purpose language models now routinely generate convincing emulations of poetic form. While researchers have closely examined such machine-generated poetry, few have studied human-AI collaboration in poetry writing from a posthuman perspective. Through semi-structured interviews with ten participants in an AI English poetry contest and an analysis of their dialogs with AIs, we summarize the affordances and challenges of such collaborative practice using posthumanism as a lens. We then expose interesting tensions, for example, between human self-expression and the diminished (or relocated) agency that AI collaboration often entails. This collaborative, yet often adversarial, process provides insights into the nature of the posthuman condition as regards creative collaboration between human and machine.},

  abstract = {Most of the attention on GenAI in computing education has focused on programming-centric tasks, such as code generation, giving feedback on code, or providing synthetic programming partners. Yet in advanced software engineering and project courses, interpersonal skills such as team meetings or customer interviews are equally important but difficult and instructor-intensive to teach realistically. GenAI presents the possibility of scaffolding the teaching of some of these practices by enabling exercises in which students develop the ability to investigate a topic by iteratively asking questions to find a solution. The goal is to create scenarios in which students train to interact with humans in real-world situations, simulating these interactions in a controlled, guided environment. These simulations could help students practice and refine ''soft skills,'' such as teamwork and interviewing, by mimicking the types of exchanges and problem-solving they would encounter in professional environments. This approach allows learners to engage in realistic communication exercises, improving their ability to handle complex, interpersonal tasks through repeated practice with AI-guided feedback. As an example, we envision examples that include requirements elicitation with customers, development team meetings, and discussion with potential investors, to name just a few.},

  abstract = {There are a large number of violations of safety regulations at the construction site of the power grid. These behaviors do not comply with safety supervision norms and can cause significant safety hazards. In response to the problem of difficulty in capturing and alerting such violations, we have designed an intelligent recognition system for violations based on enhanced YOLOv5 and generative visual big models to automatically detect violations and potential safety hazards at the construction site of the power grid. We have constructed a private dataset of violations at the construction site of the power grid. In our improved YOLOv5 model, we first added a spatial channel attention mechanism to the Neck section of Yolov5 to enhance its ability to extract spatial features and distinguish between different channel features, enabling the network to better distinguish different targets. In addition, we have added a spatial attention mechanism after the SPP of the backbone network, which enables the network to fully utilize spatial information, extract more prominent features, and improve the accuracy and recall of the model. In addition, to compensate for the lack of negative samples in the dataset, we use a generative visual model to generate a large number of negative sample images to enhance the dataset and address the issue of insufficient negative samples. We have designed a real-time safety supervision intelligent system for detecting violations on construction sites based on the above model and method, using IoT devices such as on-site real-time cameras, intermediate data servers, and routers. We conducted extensive experiments on real construction site datasets, and the results showed that our method has significantly improved compared to the original model. The MAP of the system is 94.0%, indicating that the model has strong detection ability and robustness in identifying personnel and safety tools in power grid construction site scenarios.},

While the European Union is currently leading the way with its AI Act, many other legislators will follow and already positioned themselves with white papers and other publications. This commentary argues that “Artificial Intelligence”, including Generative AI, should not be used as a regulatory category. Not because there is no potential for harm from AI systems and not because AI systems should not be regulated, but because “Artificial Intelligence” is a vaguely defined label that is neither suitable nor necessary for comprehensive regulation of technological risks. Instead of regulating a particular set of approaches and algorithms, lawmakers should focus and double down on regulating high-risk applications of software, independent of whether it is labelled as AI or not.},

This progress did not occur in a vacuum. AI emerged against a rich background of technologies from computer science and ideas about intelligence and learning from philosophy, psychology, logic, game theory, and cognitive science. We sketch out the enabling technologies for AI. They include search, reasoning, neural networks, natural language processing, signal processing and computer graphics, programming and conventional software engineering, human-computer interaction, communications, and specialized hardware that provides supercomputing power. Beyond these technologies is the notion of Artificial General Intelligence that has or exceeds the capabilities of the human brain. Currently this is completely aspirational and is not expected to be possible before 2025, if ever. Artificial Intelligence is based on a variety of technologies, none of which seek to emulate human intelligence.},

This is possible due to the development of the discipline in the last decades, to a state in which we have qualified people (software engineers, practitioners, and researchers), proper processes, and cutting-edge technologies. To achieve this current state, the discipline of software engineering has been advanced by private companies, open-source communities, government agencies, and universities. What do all those different institutions have in common? They have talented, smart, and creative people. The doctoral degree is the highest academic degree, focusing on educating and preparing talented, smart, and creative people. While the discipline of software engineering has seen great development, the new demands from society and the emergence of new technologies (e.g., generative artificial intelligence, quantum computing, Internet of Things) create new challenges and uncover old ones. In this context, the current generation of doctoral students will be in charge of taming such new technologies to meet the demands for the benefit of humanity. Given this crucial role of doctoral students in the future of software engineering, we need to discuss what the expectations, responsibilities, benefits, and barriers are faced by a doctoral student. In this talk, I share my experiences as a software developer, doctoral student, post-doc researcher, and professor directly working with software engineering in the past 20 years. This talk aims to inspire and guide students as they navigate the complexities and milestones of their doctoral studies. The topics of talk involve collaboration with your pairs, publication of your work results, understanding your community (e.g., researchers and practitioners working on the domain of variability and systematic reuse), what students should do and what they should not do, and some provocative discussion to motivate critical thinking by the audience. After the talk, the students will be equipped with practical suggestions and advice so that they can avoid pitfalls, recognize good opportunities to grow, and plan their future careers.},

  abstract = {Software development activities must adhere to industry, national, and/or international regulatory standards to ensure security, safety, and other important properties in high-stakes, regulated domains, such as healthcare, automotive, and aerospace. These software standards are often codified via multiple documents, ranging from specific requirements to general guidance. Software developers must demonstrate—and regulatory authorities must then verify—the completeness and consistency between the software artifacts and the software regulatory documents. Detecting regulatory document incompleteness, inconsistencies, and/or discrepancies (DIID) with respect to software artifacts is important for both developers and regulators because they indicate potential non-conformance and/or software regulatory risk.DIID detection is currently a human-intensive activity where people learn the standards and then review or search software artifacts to find or detect potential issues. This tedious and error-prone manual process is even more challenging with continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines that create frequent software updates. In addition, software artifacts (such as requirements or architecture documents) and software standards also change as the software is maintained, requiring ongoing manual reviews and revisions.Generative AI can accelerate DIID detection for different documents and data sources. This paper explores how generative AI, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), can accelerate DIID detection in software artifacts, particularly when comparing trusted documents like safety standards with software development artifacts. Integrating LLMs into the software development lifecycle (SDLC) to detect DIID can improve specific development activities, as well as enable transformative opportunities by accelerating end-to-end SDLC workflows and regulatory compliance. Current LLM benchmarks and testing frameworks do not sufficiently test for detecting DIID and require extension to adequately and consistently detect DIID across multiple SDLC activities. This position paper describes how LLMs can accelerate software assurance processes and ensure greater compliance with industry standards and government regulatory requirements.},

  abstract = {University students' adoption of generative AI tools in educational contexts is investigated in this research through two complementary studies. A Jordanian-based cross-sectional study (N=95) initially established the middle students' familiarity (M=3.14, SD=0.81) with generative AI writing tools, along with significant concerns about misinformation/data security (M=3.35, SD=0.85), but high awareness regarding advantages for creativity simulation and innovation facilitation (M=3.62, SD=0.81). Second, a Chinese UTAUT-based research (N=361) employing SEM-ANN hybrid analysis found that DeepSeek adoption intention is significantly determined by Perceived Price (β=0.346), Performance Expectancy (β=0.244), Effort Expectancy (β=0.233), eXplainable AI (β=0.126), and Facilitating Conditions (β=0.084), while Social Influence did not appear to be significant (β=−0.019). Moderator analysis found gender and education level to significantly moderate some predictor-intention relationships. Synthetically, these findings demonstrate: (a) cultural consensus in recognition of AI's value for learning in various capacities despite technical challenges, (b) the critical role of cost disclosure, usability, and explainability in adoption, and (c) stratified intervention needs to address technical instruction, ethical literacy, cost reduction, and maximization of usability – particularly through personalized learning deployments. The study supports the UTAUT's efficacy for use in AI adoption studies while enriching methodology integration through SEM-ANN methods.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology and the upgrading of industrial structure, the demand changes in the labor market show more complex dynamic characteristics, and it is difficult for traditional statistical and machine learning methods to accurately predict market trends. In order to improve the prediction accuracy and model adaptability, this paper proposes a labor demand prediction model based on generative adversarial deep learning (GADL) and multi-modal data fusion. The model uses generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate supplementary data to compensate for data scarcity, combined with convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer to conduct multimodal feature extraction, and finally time series modeling by long and short-term memory network (LSTM). The experimental results show that the GADL model is better than the LSTM and ARIMA method in several key performance indicators, and the mean square error (MSE) is reduced to 5% of the traditional method, and the determination coefficient (R²) reaches 0.9966, which significantly improves the prediction accuracy. The research shows that GADL model can more effectively capture the changing trend of labor market and provide data support for the optimization of government employment policy, enterprise human resource planning and talent training in universities. The study in this paper provides a new methodology for labor market prediction and lays the foundation for subsequent research.},

However, the impact of chatbot-assisted learning on higher-order thinking skills is not yet known. In this study, a chatbot named C4D Helper was developed by using Coze, a chatbot creation platform in China like Google's Dialogflow. A chatbot-assisted learning model was designed based on the Design Thinking framework to cultivate students' higher-order thinking skills. In order to examine the effectiveness of this model, a pre-posttest quasi-experiment lasting for 5 weeks was conducted. The students in two classes, majoring in Digital Media Technology at Kashi University, were randomly assigned to control group(CG, n=31) and experimental group (EG, n=31). Students in CG learned by traditional teaching model while students in EG learned by chatbot-assisted learning model. The results showed that the chatbot-assisted learning model can significantly improve higher-order thinking skills, including problem-solving skills, critical thinking, creative thinking, and cooperation skills.},

AI is developing fast, with a large number of applications shown, such as polishing the statement. The rapid development of AI has allowed its integration into various sectors, including 3D printing. While the applications of AI in many industrial systems have been identified by existing studies, the applications of this emerging technology in another promising technology – 3D printing – have been largely unexplored. This points out the necessity of conducting researches on this issue to facilitate the further development of both AI and 3D printing technologies. This study examines the application of AI across different phases of 3D printing, such as design, usage, production, and maintenance. AI enhances the efficiency of 3D printing by providing generative design alternatives, automating parameter settings, optimizing process controls, and improving product quality through real-time monitoring. AI's ability to store and analyze vast amounts of data enables better decision-making, predictive maintenance, and customized production, reducing costs and enhancing production capabilities. However, AI implementation in 3D printing also faces challenges, including system complexity, data privacy concerns, and the need for extensive sensor networks. As AI technologies continue to evolve, they promise further advancements in flexibility, precision, and cost-efficiency, potentially revolutionizing the 3D printing industry. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of AI's applications in 3D printing, offering insights into how AI can drive future innovation in additive manufacturing.},

  abstract = {Large Language Model (LLM) inference uses an autoregressive manner to generate one token at a time, which exhibits notably lower operational intensity compared to earlier Machine Learning (ML) models such as encoder-only transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks. At the same time, LLMs possess large parameter sizes and use key-value caches to store context information. Modern LLMs support context windows with up to 1 million tokens to generate versatile text, audio, and video content. A large key-value cache unique to each prompt requires a large memory capacity, limiting the inference batch size. Both low operational intensity and limited batch size necessitate a high memory bandwidth. However, contemporary hardware systems for ML model deployment, such as GPUs and TPUs, are primarily optimized for compute throughput. This mismatch challenges the efficient deployment of advanced LLMs and makes users to pay for expensive compute resources that are poorly utilized for the memory-bound LLM inference tasks.We propose CENT, a CXL-ENabled GPU-Free sysTem for LLM inference, which harnesses CXL memory expansion capabilities to accommodate substantial LLM sizes, and utilizes near-bank processing units to deliver high memory bandwidth, eliminating the need for expensive GPUs. CENT exploits a scalable CXL network to support peer-to-peer and collective communication primitives across CXL devices. We implement various parallelism strategies to distribute LLMs across these devices. Compared to GPU baselines with maximum supported batch sizes and similar average power, CENT achieves 2.3x higher throughput and consumes 2.3x less energy. CENT reduces the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), generating 5.2x more tokens per dollar than GPUs.},

However, the proliferation of generated images has also raised issues such as information distortion, which poses challenges to the protection of original content and the assurance of information authenticity. As a result, many detection methods have been proposed in recent years to identify generated images. By analysing existing AIGC detection methods, we categorise them into four groups: frequency domain features, traditional models, image reconstruction and multi-modal large models. Through comparative analysis, this paper highlights the advantages and limitations of current detection methods and outlines potential research directions for the future. Our aim is to provide valuable insights to researchers in related fields, thereby promoting the further development of AIGC detection technology and enhancing our ability to address the challenges posed by AIGC.},

Due to its laborious nature, developers hardly adopt Design by Contract in practice.    A plethora of research on (semi-)-automated inference to reduce the manual burden has not improved the adoption of so-called code contracts in practice.    This paper examines the potential of Generative AI to automatically generate code contracts in terms of pre- and postconditions for any Java project without requiring any additional auxiliary artifact.    To fine-tune two state-of-the-art Large Language Models, CodeT5 and CodeT5+, we derive a dataset of more than 14k Java methods comprising contracts in form of Java Modeling Language (JML) annotations, and train the models on the task of generating contracts.    We examine the syntactic and semantic validity of the contracts generated for software projects not used in the fine-tuning and find that more than 95% of the generated contracts are syntactically correct and exhibit remarkably high completeness and semantic correctness.    To this end, our fully automated method sets the stage for future research and eventual broader adoption of Design by Contract in software development practice.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have shown incredible promise for zero shot image-to-image translation and editing. Most of these approaches work by combining or replacing network-specific features used in the generation of new images with those taken from the inversion of some guide image. Methods of this type are considered the current state-of-the-art in training-free approaches, but have some notable limitations: they tend to be costly in runtime and memory, and often depend on deterministic sampling that limits variation in generated results. We propose Filter-Guided Diffusion (FGD), an alternative approach that leverages fast filtering operations during the diffusion process to support finer control over the strength and frequencies of guidance and can work with non-deterministic samplers to produce greater variety. With its efficiency, FGD can be sampled over multiple seeds and hyperparameters in less time than a single run of other SOTA methods to produce superior results based on structural and semantic metrics. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments to evaluate the performance of FGD in translation tasks and also demonstrate its potential in localized editing when used with masks.},

The uncertain preference estimation of evolutionary individuals is realized. The user preference model is adjusted according to the uncertainty evaluation, and the user preference is dynamically tracked to obtain the fitness value of the evolutionary individual for evolutionary optimization.

The study highlights how multimodal interaction, empathy, personalization, augmentation, bias stereotyping, and privacy and security affect the extent to which elderly consumers perceive GAI as trustworthy. Findings indicate that multimodal interaction, personalization, augmentation, and bias stereotyping significantly influenced the trust relationship between the elderly population and GAI. However, empathy privacy, and security were found to be insignificant in trust relationships. Further trust relationships significantly impacted GAI usage. The research provides strong theoretical and practical implications as all the stakeholders like healthcare professionals, patients/users, caregivers, and technology developers can be involved in building applications that cater to diverse needs and promote positive social interactions that can enhance GAI trust and usage.},

Current evaluations primarily depend on subjective questionnaire data or code quality metrics. A supplemental objective, continuous, real-time developer-centered measure is missing. Wearables with body sensors that measure the physiological activity of a person have the aforementioned benefits. With their help, impeding factors from GenAI tools on a developer's well-being and cognitive load may be detected. Implications for productivity may be deduced from these cognitive load measures. This research aims to use body sensor data to (1) assess the ability of wearables to measure developers' cognitive load in their everyday working context to then (2) evaluate developer experience, productivity and GenAI interactions in real-life work environments. A holistic mixed-method approach by combining subjective and objective measures in a developer-centered manner is taken.},

A joint of generative AI and SAMR model offers innovation potential to writing teaching, but fewer studies exist on its implementation in vocational English writing teaching. This study enlisted students from two comparable classes of writing courses in a vocational school. The control group was instructed in generative AI supported writing instruction based on the SAMR model, while the control group was instructed in traditional writing instruction. Writing tests were given before and after teaching, and score data were collected and analyzed in terms of several aspects. The test results showed that the experimental group students' writing scores improved significantly with a dense distribution of scores and the number of students scoring high. The improvement in the control group was smaller, with a diffuse distribution and wide fluctuation. Independent sample t-tests also confirmed the effectiveness of the new teaching method. The study provides strong evidence for the reform of English writing education in vocational colleges.},

Generative AI is also gradually becoming an interaction mode between enterprises and customers, improving customer experience and influencing their continued use intention. However, there is still uncertainty as to whether users are willing to use generative AI-driven products and services for a long time. Previous studies have mostly been based on traditional industries. How to enhance users’ continued use intention from the perspective of AI has become a widely concerned issue in academia and industry.Based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Expectation Confirmation Theory (ECT), this study explores the impact of generative AI features on users’ continued use intention by improving the two paths of user perceived value and user satisfaction. 306 valid questionnaires were used, and SPSS 27.0 and SEM were used for data analysis and hypothesis testing. The results show that (1) generative AI features have a significant positive impact on users’ continued use intention; (2) user perceived value and user satisfaction play a mediating role in the relationship between generative AI features and users’ continued use intention. This finding improves users’ continued use intention of generative AI features, which is of great significance for understanding the marketing layout of generative AI for enterprises.},

However, small and medium-sized enterprises generally face bottlenecks such as high investment threshold, lack of talents and difficult scene adaptation in the process of technology landing. This study focuses on the feasibility discrimination problem of enterprise application of artificial intelligence technology, and proposes a deep learning framework based on LSTM-Transformer hybrid model. By integrating the three types of time series characteristics of enterprise basic information, business dynamics and technology application data, a multi-dimensional evaluation system is constructed. The model adopts layered architecture: LSTM layer captures short-term business fluctuations, Transformer layer mines long-term correlation between technical input and business effectiveness, and finally realizes two-classification of "feasible" and "temporarily infeasible" through Softmax. Based on the six-year data of 2006 enterprises, the mixed model accuracy reached 89.06% (±0.31%) and F1 score was 87.88% (±0.36%), which was significantly better than the single model and CNN-LSTM baseline. Confusion matrix shows that 93.7% of high recall guarantees the identification of potential enterprises, and 74.4% of specificity reveals negative class discrimination optimization space.

  abstract = {This paper takes the group standards of China's artificial intelligence-related industries as the research object and analyzes the characteristics of participating drafting units and group standard organizations in the group standard cooperation network based on the structural characteristics such as centrality and network density obtained from social network analysis. The study finds that although the development time of group standards in China's artificial intelligence-related industries is short, the development is rapid, and the cooperation network has basically taken shape. The central positions of some group standard organizations and participating drafting units have been initially formed. However, it can also be seen that some group standard organizations, despite having a close relationship with participating drafting units, have not yet established connections with the overall network, indicating that the overall cooperation network is still loose, and only some group standard organizations play relatively key roles in constructing the network for the formulation of group standards in the artificial intelligence-related industries. In the process of promoting the maturity of the cooperation network of group standards in artificial intelligence-related industries, there are still many challenges and room for optimization. On the one hand, it is urgent to take effective measures to strengthen the connections among all entities within the network, reduce the looseness of the network, and improve the overall collaborative efficiency, such as establishing an information sharing platform. On the other hand, group standard organizations and participating drafting units in central positions should give full play to their leading and exemplary roles, and drive the common development of other entities within the network through means such as technical assistance and experience sharing. In addition, the government and industry associations should also play an active role by introducing targeted policies and regulations to guide the formulation and implementation of group standards for artificial intelligence, urging all parties involved to strengthen cooperation and build a more complete standard system. Looking ahead, with the continuous deepening of collaborative governance by all parties, the cooperation network of group standards in the artificial intelligence industry will continue to be optimized and upgraded. It will not only promote the high-quality development of China's artificial intelligence industry but also demonstrate China's wisdom in the field of global artificial intelligence standard setting and enhance China's international discourse power and influence in this field.},

Adoption of GenAI may help with the progression from novice to expert, while freeing up time and resources for other work. Challenges include the potential loss of critical organizational knowledge, definition of job-related requirements, expectations, and tasks, as well as over-reliance and loss of tacit or unarticulated knowledge. These challenges must be balanced against available access to large amounts of general and domain-specific knowledge from GenAI to capture the value realized from its adoption.},

  abstract = {The landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) has experienced a monumental shift with the emerging of Generative AI (GenAI), which has demonstrated to be a transformative tool across diverse sectors. GenAI outputs can span various digital formats, including text, images, videos, and audio, generating particular interest in the public sector. The growing interest of governments in integrating GenAI technologies in public sector operations is marked by the creation of emerging governance instruments and the formulation of soft laws, like standards, principles, and guidelines. This study aims to delve into the intricacies and potential risks associated with the deployment of GenAI within government. Through a qualitative content analysis, the research meticulously examines GenAI usage guidelines issued by Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and South Korea. The objective is to discern the risks acknowledged by these countries' soft laws and compare them with the risks identified by scholars in the field. The performed comparative analysis across countries suggest that the use of GenAI in the public sector raises common risks such as information leakage, data privacy, security, and concerns over public trust. By elucidating the varied risk perceptions across different national contexts, this study provides theoretical and practical implications related to the risks of GenAI within the public sector. Moreover, it sets a foundation for future research and policy development, ensuring that generative AI is used as a force for good in public governance.},

  abstract = {This paper builds upon Lynette Hunter's foundational argument that artificial intelligence (AI) lacks rhetorical “stance” by emphasizing the essential role of context in both human reasoning and the development of technological systems. Drawing on rhetorical theory and cognitive science, particularly the interactionist model of reasoning by Dan Sperber and Hugo Mercier, we challenge reductive, context-free understandings of rationality embedded in AI and platform-driven algorithmic ecologies. We argue that contemporary digital technologies, especially algorithmic systems underpinning platforms, operate through a rhetoric that flattens nuance, shapes user behavior, and undermines democratic participation. By invoking Philip Wander's concept of “rhetorical contextualization,” the paper highlights how rhetorical inquiry can uncover what is omitted, censored, or rendered invisible in technological design. We advocate for a reimagined Semantic Web, one guided by critical, ethical, and context-aware frameworks, to realize AI's potential for human flourishing. Ultimately, we position rhetorical theory not only as a tool of critique, but as a blueprint for designing more just and responsive digital futures.},

The Chinese government has introduced a number of strategic policies to promote the development of new generation artificial intelligence and has made significant progress, but there are still large differences in the research and development, application and industrialization of AI technology in different regions. To this end, this research sorted out the definition of new generation artificial intelligence and established a comprehensive evaluation index system including four dimensions: development scale, economic benefits, innovation input and scientific and technological output. Based on panel data from 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, the entropy method was used to analyze the development level of new generation artificial intelligence in various regions from 2017 to 2021. The results show that the overall development level of China's new generation of artificial intelligence shows a steady growth trend. The development of AI in the eastern region leads the country, while the development level of AI in the central, western and northeastern regions is relatively low, and the gap is widening year by year.},

However, traditional SiPSAs are predominantly thermally cured solvent-based products, which not only exhibit slow curing rates but also release harmful solvents like toluene during application, causing environmental pollution. To address this issue, this study Under the background of artificial intelligence. synthesized thiol-functionalized MTQ silicone resins (MTQ-SH) with various M/(T+Q) ratios using γ-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane, tetraethyl orthosilicate, and hexamethyldisiloxane as raw materials. These resins were then photo-crosslinked with vinyl-terminated silicone oil to prepare UV-curable silicone PSAs (UV-SiPSAs). The results revealed that the optimal precursor ratio for UV-SiPSA preparation was M/T/Q = 1.00/0.21/1.58. When the photoinitiator TPO-L was added at 1 wt.% and the molar ratio of thiol groups to vinyl end groups was 1.2:1, the resulting UV-SiPSA exhibited an initial adhesion strength capable of holding a 22# steel ball and a holding time of 230 minutes at 25℃. This UV-curable PSA shows promising potential for replacing traditional thermally cured silicone PSAs in the protective film industry.},

The review study narrates research on AI-driven approaches: machine learning, deep learning, federated learning, and generative algorithms (GAs) for fault diagnosis. Internet of Things (IoT) enabled real-time monitoring and intelligence maintenance techniques. Recurrent neural networks particularly long short-term memory (LSTM) models and ML techniques analyse the sensor data for prediction of stress, wear, and failure modes of components, achieving high accuracy and enabling proactive interventions. The results reveal that IoT networks coupled with AI approaches continuously monitor critical parameters including vibration and temperature. This study reveals that optimization techniques, genetic algorithms, and particle swarm optimization play significant roles in enhancing the structural design of components like gears and connecting rods that achieve weight reductions without compromising safety. This study identifies challenges of model interpretability, data scarcity, and regulatory compliance. These issues are addressed by proposing hybrid AI models and federated learning. Emerging trends include self-healing materials, quantum ML approaches, and automated maintenance systems, which could transform safety in the aviation industry. By bridging research gaps between engineering practices and data-driven insights, this study shows that AI can play a vital role in advancing the efficiency and reliability of drive mechanisms in next-generation aircraft, compliance with aviation protocols, and paving the way for adaptive and autonomous systems.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is integrated with various domains for design education — expanding creativity, problem-solving, design methodologies, research, etc. due to its ability to simulate human cognition and behavior. Using systematic review and content analysis, this study conducts a systematic review to understand the AI-powered curriculum innovation trends in design education. From the analyzed papers, five emerging themes were identified: (1) Art and Design Education, (2) Visual Communication and Graphic Design, (3) Integration and Innovation of AI in Design Education, (4) Design Thinking and AI for Education, and (5) Generative AI for Design and Fashion. The results suggest that AI has evolved from a foundational technical tool to a transformative force changing how we learn, update curricula, and assess knowledge. Although AI is a game changer in terms of efficiency and finding different creative paths, the ethics and influence on the design process will have to be examined thoroughly. Future research directions may include human-AI collaboration in pedagogy, the ethics of AI-generated design content, and learner adaptation to AI-enabled design education. This research offers the most recent review of AI in practice in design schools, helping educators and policymakers alike shape the role AI plays within the design education context.},

  abstract = {Observers and practitioners of artificial intelligence (AI) have proposed an FDA-style licensing regime for the most advanced AI models, or 'frontier' models. In this paper, we explore the applicability of approval regulation - that is, regulation of a product that combines experimental minima with government licensure conditioned partially or fully upon that experimentation - to the regulation of frontier AI. There are a number of reasons to believe that approval regulation, simplistically applied, would be inapposite for frontier AI risks. Domains of weak fit include the difficulty of defining the regulated product, the presence of Knightian uncertainty or deep ambiguity about harms from AI, the potentially transmissible nature of risks, and distributed activities among actors involved in the AI lifecycle. We conclude by highlighting the role of policy learning and experimentation in regulatory development, describing how learning from other forms of AI regulation and improvements in evaluation and testing methods can help to overcome some of the challenges we identify.},

  abstract = {This article aims to explore the consistency between a few popular generative AI robots in the evaluation of e-learning platforms. The three robots adopted in the study were GPT-4, Sage, and Dragonfly, which were requested to award rating scores to the six major dimensions, namely (1) features and capabilities, (2) ease of use and customization, (3) cost, (4) security, (5) customer support, and (6) scalability, of 10 to 20 currently most popular e-learning platforms. For each of the three robots, the minimum, the maximum, the range, and the standard deviation of the rating scores for each of the six dimensions were computed across all the e-learning platforms. The rating score difference for each of the six dimensions between any pair of robots was calculated for each platform. The mean of the absolute value, the minimum, the maximum, the range, and the standard deviation of the differences for each dimensions between each pair of robots were calculated across all platforms. Finally, a Cronbach alpha coefficient of the rating scores was computed for each of the six dimensions between all the three robots across all the e-learning platforms. The computational results were to reveal whether the three robots accorded discrimination in evaluating each dimension across the platforms and whether there was consistency between the three robots in evaluating each dimension across the platforms. Among some auxiliary results, it was found that the evaluation by the three robots was severely inconsistent for the two dimensions cost and security, inconsistent to a lesser extent for the dimension scalability, and consistent for the remaining three dimensions.},

We conducted a probe-based, group autoethnography study to explore how dream sharing was influenced in the way of relay and with GAI. Results showed how participants recorded their dreams and perceived the AI-generated dream visuals. This study also highlighted the value of GAI in sparking imagination and alleviating personal privacy concerns, which increased the willingness to share.

The results show that both students and faculty perceive that AI is transforming higher education, and faculty are exploring AI integration in their work. However, many faculty have concerns about the negative effects of students' use of generative AI and continue to educate them on responsible use of AI for learning. Such concerns influence how faculty assess student learning reverting to in-person assessments among other strategies. Overall, the consensus is that AI is transforming higher education, and there is a need for institutions, faculty and students to adapt to this reality.},

Two online surveys, involving 197 educators, followed by interviews with 10 Cypriot educators were conducted to examine how they perceive AI. The findings revealed a shared conceptualization of AI as “human-like”, intelligent machines, capable of learning and solving problems using data. Notable differences in the definitions of AI emerged between Cypriot educators and their international counterparts. Furthermore, the findings showed that even though educators perceive teaching AI as important, they lack formal training and specialized educational tools on AI, underscoring the urgent need for targeted interventions and tailored resources.},

Specifically, swarm intelligence exhibits properties well-suited to enhance GAN training: emergent complex behaviors arising from simple individual agents, decentralized adaptability to instantaneous data and hyperparameters, and robustness through simple iterative interactions. SwarmGAN incorporates a particle swarm optimization algorithm to guide generator and discriminator updates. Convolutional neural network architectures and gradient penalties further ensure baseline generation quality and diversity. Extensive experiments over diverse image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SwarmGAN. Quantitative evaluations using Fr\'{e}chet Inception Distance, Inception Score, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio, and Structural Similarity Index Score validate performance improvements across stability, sample quality, and convergence speed. The proposed integration of swarm intelligence into adversarial networks shows promising capability to address long-standing GAN challenges.},

This is an important question because users’ mental models guide their behaviors, including making decisions that impact their privacy. Through 21 semi-structured interviews, we uncovered users’ four mental models towards first-party (e.g., Google Gemini) and third-party (e.g., ChatGPT) GenAI Chatbot Ecosystems. These mental models centered around the role of the chatbot in the entire ecosystem. We further found that participants held a more consistent and simpler mental model towards third-party ecosystems than the first-party ones, resulting in higher trust and fewer concerns towards the third-party ecosystems.

  abstract = {Generative AI (GenAI) is advancing rapidly, and the literature in computing education is expanding almost as quickly. Initial responses to GenAI tools were mixed between panic and utopian optimism. Many were fast to point out the opportunities and challenges of GenAI. Researchers reported that these new tools are capable of solving most introductory programming tasks and are causing disruptions throughout the curriculum. These tools can write and explain code, enhance error messages, create resources for instructors, and even provide feedback and help for students like a traditional teaching assistant. In 2024, new research started to emerge on the effects of GenAI usage in the computing classroom. These new data involve the use of GenAI to support classroom instruction at scale and to teach students how to code with GenAI. In support of the former, a new class of tools is emerging that can provide personalized feedback to students on their programming assignments or teach both programming and prompting skills at the same time. With the literature expanding so rapidly, this report aims to summarize and explain what is happening on the ground in computing classrooms. We provide a systematic literature review; a survey of educators and industry professionals; and interviews with educators using GenAI in their courses, educators studying GenAI, and researchers who create GenAI tools to support computing education. The triangulation of these methods and data sources expands the understanding of GenAI usage and perceptions at this critical moment for our community.},

Driven by the “disruptive technology revolution” in different fields, AI is reshaping knowledge acquisition, teaching and learning, from personalized learning systems to the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), the traditional “factory” mode of education is difficult to adapt to personalized learning development needs. Learning development needs, and artificial intelligence-driven systems in support of adaptive learning, intelligent tutoring and automatic assessment, in addition to greatly improve the learning efficiency “liberation of productivity”, but also to change the way of knowledge transfer, affect human cognition and independent learning. It is foreseeable that the competition for education in the age of artificial intelligence may shift from knowledge accumulation to computational power domination. That is to say, individuals with more computing power will have access to better learning resources, which will definitely increase the “digital education gap” on the other hand. This paper analyzes the current situation, challenges, and future trends of AI in education, and explores the impact of AI on self-directed learning, cognitive processes, and the possible evolution of education towards computational competitiveness. Using research methods such as literature review, case study, and technology trend prediction, this study combines the theories of cognitive science, philosophy of AI, and pedagogy to assess the educational impact of AI and propose policy recommendations to promote equity and optimize AI cooperation.},

In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) based methods, especially deep learning methods, have shown promising performance in UOD. To further facilitate future advancements, we comprehensively study AI-based UOD. In this survey, we first categorise existing algorithms into traditional machine learning-based methods and deep learning-based methods, and summarise them by considering learning strategies, experimental datasets, learning stages, employed features or techniques, and underlying frameworks. Next, we discuss the potential challenges and suggest possible solutions and new directions. We also perform both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of mainstream algorithms across multiple benchmark datasets, taking into account the diversity and biases in experimental setups. Finally, we introduce two off-the-shelf detection analysis tools, Diagnosis and TIDE, which will examine the effects of object characteristics and various types of errors on detector performance. These tools help identify the strengths and weaknesses of different detectors, providing insights for further improvement. The source code, trained models, utilised datasets, detection results, and detection analysis tools are publicly available at  and will be regularly updated.},

Purposeful sampling was employed to select participants in this study, and the interviews were conducted face-to-face at the university campus. The study's underlying theory is the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model, including effort expectancy, performance expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions, which were employed as a lens to direct the research. The data were transcribed and analyzed using the deductive approach for the thematic analysis. The findings revealed that lecturers have a positive attitude to adopt and use AI for content creation, assessment and feedback, and doing research in their institution. Some instructors may see it as a valuable tool for generating creative content and aiding student learning. In contrast, others may have concerns about its potential to replace human creativity or biases in generated materials. Lecturers also view AI as a technology to achieve accessibility and equity after overcoming the challenges.

Practice has proven that AI can dynamically optimise teaching. However, there are challenges in AI application: over-reliance on technology undermines teacher-student interaction, algorithmic bias exacerbates educational injustice, and data privacy risks need to be regulated. The study emphasises that AI in education should be based on the essence of “educating people”, and promote the role of teachers to shift from “knowledge transfer” to “growth guidance” under the ethical framework, and synergise technological empowerment and humanistic care. The future needs to explore localised adaptation paths. In the future, it is necessary to explore the local adaptation path, not only to make use of AI to break through the bottleneck of large-scale education but also to prevent the alienation of the technology, and build an intelligent education ecology of “teaching in accordance with one's aptitude”.},

  abstract = {In the context of the information era of rapid development of artificial intelligence, the frequency of data updating and the role of data is always in dynamic change, and the research of design behavior is facing new opportunities and challenges. This paper focuses on the study of factors affecting design behavior in the view of artificial intelligence, aiming to analyze the weight of each influencing factor accurately. Through the hierarchical analysis method (AHP), its advantage of quantitative subjective judgment is brought into play, and experts' subjective perception of the importance of design behavior factors is deeply explored. At the same time, combined with the entropy weight method, the weights are determined based on the objective information entropy of the data, which effectively makes up for the lack of subjective assignment. Using the AHP-entropy weight method combined with these two methods, a comprehensive and systematic weight evaluation of design behavior factors is carried out to improve the efficiency of multi-attribute decision-making.},

Despite their similarities, the most effective representation methods for these steps differ, leading to inefficiencies, limited representativeness, and reduced interpretability. In this paper, we introduce KGGLM, a decoder-only Transformer model designed for generalizable knowledge representation learning to support recommendation. The model is trained on generic paths sampled from the knowledge graph to capture foundational patterns, and then fine-tuned on paths specific of the downstream step (knowledge completion and path reasoning in our case).

  abstract = {Abstract In an era increasingly shaped by artificial intelligence, the analysis and preservation of cultural heritage are undergoing a profound transformation. AI is redefining how we document, interpret and engage with archaeological sites, cultural artifacts and historical narratives. This conference presents a selection of AI and machine learning applications in the humanities, with a particular focus on archaeology. It examines the conditions under which advanced learning models are being adopted in this field, addressing the unique challenges posed by the nature and availability of archaeological data. Unlike disciplines that benefit from large, continuously generated datasets, archaeology often relies on data that is produced slowly and in limited quantities. This scarcity presents both challenges and opportunities for adapting AI methodologies. Among the most compelling applications are the recognition and retrieval of 3D models for shape-based search engines, the extraction of information from historical documents and the classification of archaeological artifacts. During the conference two studies are presented: The first explores a common need of cultural institutions: facilitating access to digital 3D models of cultural heritage objects. This challenge is met through the development of MeshAnalizer, a shape-based search engine for 3D models. Unlike traditional systems that rely on textual input, MeshAnalizer uses geometric shape descriptors to identify and retrieve similar models from local or online repositories. The system follows a four-step methodology: calculating shape descriptors, comparing them using mathematical metrics, constructing an index, and enabling query-by-example retrieval. MeshAnalizer enables users to search by uploading a representative 3D model, returning ranked results based on geometric similarity. This approach enhances access to digital heritage collections and supports research, education, and public engagement (Jim\'{e}nez-Badillo et al., 2021, 2024).  The second study explores the integration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Corpus Linguistics in the analysis of historical documents. The project developed innovative methodologies and software tools for the automated analysis of digitized texts, particularly the Relaciones Geogr\'{a}ficas de Nueva Espa\~{n}a, a XVI century corpus that contains important information on social, economic and territorial organization. Central to the methodology was a Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation (NERD) model built using convolutional neural networks and word embeddings via SpaCy, which identified and categorized historically significant entities within the corpus. Achieving nearly 90% accuracy, the model was trained and validated on manually annotated datasets. The project also applied a methodology called Geographical Text Analysis (GTA). The combination of NERD and GTA allow implementing two key software tools that facilitate spatial analysis and support complex historical inquiries, offering new insights into colonial territorial organization, resource management, and sociocultural dynamics (Jim\'{e}nez-Badillo et al. 2020, 2021; Murrieta-Flores et al., 2022, 2025). The goal of the presentation is to demonstrate that cutting-edge learning models can unlock new insights in domains traditionally limited by data scarcity. The conference will showcase both the technical hurdles and the innovative solutions that emerge when applying AI in these contexts. Through case studies and emerging methodologies, this conference invite scholars, technologists, and cultural practitioners to reflect on the evolving relationship between machine intelligence specialists and cultural heritage professionals –and to envision a future where cultural heritage is not only preserved but dynamically reimagined through innovative collaboration.},

However, there are still challenges in EMR interoperability, security, and data exchange. To address these existing limitations, This study proposes a voice electronic medical record system driven by artificial intelligence and blockchain, which is designed to improve clinical records and nursing coordination. This system adopts a dedicated deep learning architecture. It transcribe the conversations between doctors and patients into text, and then uses natural language processing to extract the relevant medical information. At the same time, it also provides diagnostic prompts, which can reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Doctors can view and edit these summaries generated by artificial intelligence. Then safely record them on the decentralized crypto blockchain ledger. With federated learning, the model can be continuously improved in multiple centers without infringing on data privacy. This solution integrates automatic speech recognition, distributed ledger technology, and collaborative deep learning, aiming to enhance the EMR efficiency, security, data integrity, and care continuity of medical institutions. The combination of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence technology holds great potential. It can transform fragmented health data into portable and interoperable records under patient control, thus bringing strategic advantages to the health system that is undergoing a comprehensive digital transformation.},

Since such models will be integrated into future educational tools, a human-centered design approach that takes students’ perspectives into account is essential while designing such applications.This paper describes two co-design workshops which were conducted with 79 student groups to examine how they design and prototype future educational tools integrated with MLLMs. Through various activities in the workshops, students discussed relevant educational problems, created journey maps, storyboards and low fidelity prototypes for their applications, and evaluated their applications based on relevant design principles. We found that students’ applications used MLLMs for important learning environment design features such as multimodal content creation, personalization, and feedback. Based on these findings, we discuss future research directions for the design of multimodality in generative AI educational applications.},

Firstly, the concepts of artificial intelligence, context-awareness and scenic mobility scooter are introduced, and the current status of theoretical research and existing problems of scenic mobility scooter are sorted out. Secondly, combining the advantages and characteristics of context-aware intervention in the scenic scooter, the context information related to the scenic scooter under the view of artificial intelligence is divided into four categories: user, environment, task, and equipment, and at the same time, different stages of the use of the context information hierarchy is categorized and corresponds to the pain point needs, and the corresponding artificial intelligence access points are analyzed. Finally, four design strategies are proposed based on the above four contextual factors. It is concluded that the application of context-awareness theory to the design of scenic mobility scooters under the perspective of artificial intelligence strengthens the ability to perceive multidimensional contextual information, explores the user's needs in dynamic situations from a multidimensional perspective, simplifies the user's operation path, and enhances the user's touring experience.},

  abstract = {This study contributes to the global conversation on artificial intelligence (AI) literacy, with a specific focus on Uganda, a sub-Saharan African region that has received limited attention in AI education research. As AI becomes increasingly pervasive, it is essential to introduce AI concepts to young children to promote their AI literacy. However, the current landscape of AI education in Uganda is not well understood. To address this gap, this research explores a community-based approach to teaching AI and machine learning (ML) to young children in out-of-school settings. The study aims to discover the kinds of AI-related knowledge and skills that young children can develop and how they can learn about AI in a non-formal educational context. The study will employ a design science methodology (DSM) to create and evaluate practical solutions, including methods, models, and concepts, that can inform AI education in Uganda. By combining systematic literature reviews, qualitative and quantitative methods, the research will generate robust empirical evidence that supports the effectiveness and relevance of the proposed solutions. Through these methods, the research will explore the role of community-based approaches in fostering young children's AI literacy. The study will investigate the effectiveness of informal learning environments, including homes, museums, churches, and children's camps. This will provide design recommendations for community-based AI education programs and in doing so, the study addresses the limited initiatives on promoting AI education for everyone, particularly in developing regions using informal settings.},

We show that robustness and cybersecurity demand resilience against performance disruptions.

  abstract = {Engineering process management aims to formally specify processes which are executable, measurable, and controllable. Common representations include text-based domain-specific languages (DSLs) or graphical notations such as the Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN). The specification itself can be seen as a Software Product Line (SPL), building upon concepts such as tasks, UI forms, fields and actions. Domain experts provide requirements for processes but often lack the technical programming skills to formalize them in a process specification language. We present an interactive SPL application prototype that allows domain experts to model simple processes in natural language. Our framework for the reliable generation of formal specifications with Large Language Models (LLMs) supports the machine-translation from natural language to a JSON-based process DSL. In this case study, five domain experts were asked to model any process of their choice through natural-language interactions. As a result, the user interface corresponding to the process DSL was shown as immediate feedback. We documented their perceived translation quality and interviewed them on their impressions of this methodology. An average user-assessed performance rating of 68% was achieved. Even though the modelling strategies differed greatly between individuals, the tool was able to adequately capture the majority of instructions, leaving an overall positive impression on the participants. More context awareness and additional conventional interaction elements were the main aspects found to be improved for a productive implementation.},

  abstract = {The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Building Information Modeling (BIM) represents a paradigm shift in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. This change revolutionizes how buildings are designed, constructed, and managed throughout their lifecycle. Using secondary data, this research aims to evaluate the current advances in the role of AI in BIM, emphasizing leveraging AI to improve organizational performance, decision-making, and project delivery. Based on the four classifications of AI systems which are Reactive AI, Limited Memory AI, Theory of Mind AI, and Self-Aware AI, this study analyzed the prospects of BIM applications. Results show that AI in BIM applications offers capabilities across domains such as generative design, predictive maintenance, energy optimization, automated code compliance, clash detection, construction simulation, sustainability analysis, project risk assessment, facility management, and natural language processing. The research also presents major issues arising from the integration of AI in a BIM setting, including Interoperability problems, Data management problems, and Technological resistance problems. Based on the evaluation of the current status and challenges associated with AI integration, this work expects to offer practical recommendations for the stakeholders interested in implementing AI technologies within their BIM projects. In addition, the research reveals new directions in integrating AI into BIM, including digital twins and generative design that will likely transform the project lifecycle. This research fills the gap in the current literature by exploring the AI limitations and opportunities in BIM environments and thereby provides insights into the application of these technologies to enhance innovation and sustainability in construction. Finally, this research provides a basis for new and more rational approaches to construction that would meet the needs of contemporary society.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) fosters enormous business opportunities that build and utilize private AI models. Implementing AI models at scale and ensuring cost-effective production of AI-based technologies through entirely in-house capabilities is a challenge. The success of the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) Cloud Computing models can be leveraged to facilitate a cost-effective and scalable AI service paradigm, namely, “AI as a Service” (AIaaS). We summarize current state-of-the-art solutions for AIaaS, and we discuss its prospects for growth and opportunities to advance the concept. To this end, we perform a thorough review of recent research on AI and various deployment strategies for emerging domains considering both technical as well as survey articles. Next, we identify various characteristics and capabilities that need to be met before an AIaaS model can be successfully designed and deployed. Based on this, we present a general framework of an AIaaS architecture that integrates the required aaS characteristics with the capabilities of AI. We also compare various approaches for offering AIaaS to end users. Finally, we illustrate several real-world use cases for AIaaS models, followed by a discussion of some of the challenges that must be addressed to enable AIaaS adoption.},

  abstract = {Technology-mediated communication tools are widely used to maintain connections between older adults and their remote family members. However, challenges often arise due to differences in their life rhythms and communication preferences, such as time zones, daily routines, or preferred platforms. To address these challenges, we propose using Ditto, a mimetic embodied agent, in video-call-like interactions between an older adult and a remote family member. When direct interaction is difficult, FamilyDitto can represent either party, providing a strong social presence and a personalized experience to the other person. To explore the potential of Ditto in supporting intergenerational communication, we conducted seven co-design workshops (n=27) with older adults and younger family members. Our thematic analysis reveals Ditto's potential roles as both a temporal bridge and an emotional proxy, identifies the tension between faithful and idealized representations, and emphasizes the importance of personalization to support unique family dynamics. We distill our findings into implications for designing mediated semi-synchronous communication, using idealized representation responsibly, and addressing the asymmetric motivations and comfort levels with Ditto across roles and ages. This study provides a foundation for mimetic AI technologies that enhance, rather than replace, human connection in remote intergenerational relationships.},

  abstract = {The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI is fundamentally transforming information retrieval and processing on the Internet, bringing both great potential and significant concerns regarding content authenticity and reliability. This paper presents a novel quantitative approach to shed light on the complex information dynamics arising from the growing use of generative AI tools. Despite their significant impact on the digital ecosystem, these dynamics remain largely uncharted and poorly understood. We propose a stochastic model to characterize the generation, indexing, and dissemination of information in response to new topics. This scenario particularly challenges current LLMs, which often rely on real-time Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to overcome their static knowledge limitations. Our findings suggest that the rapid pace of generative AI adoption, combined with increasing user reliance, can outpace human verification, escalating the risk of inaccurate information proliferation across digital resources. An in-depth analysis of Stack Exchange data confirms that high-quality answers inevitably require substantial time and human effort to emerge. This underscores the considerable risks associated with generating persuasive text in response to new questions and highlights the critical need for responsible development and deployment of future generative AI tools.},

  abstract = {Scientific creativity (i.e., to innovate new scientific approaches or ideas) is a fundamental ability for scientists. Since the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), researchers have used specialized models to improve or automatize scientific processes and even scientific discoveries. In our study, we investigate whether proprietary large language models such as ChatGPT, though not specifically trained for scientific work, are able to convincingly perform or even surpass human scientific creativity. We asked graduate students and prompted ChatGPT to write an abbreviated version of a research proposal for a fictious scenario from the field of computer science/ robotics. Four specific assignments were given (i.e., formulating a hypothesis, designing an experiment, listing the required equipment, and justifying the chosen method). Human and AI-generated answers were rated by two scientists from the field, following a peer-review approach. Our results indicate that ChatGPT reached significantly higher overall scores relative to the human sample. However, closer inspection of the data and the rating procedure revealed that the evaluation of performance especially in regards to the originality of ideas differed considerably between the two raters. We evaluate these findings in more detail, as well as qualitative differences between human and AI- generated responses. Lastly, we discuss the impact of raters’ knowledge about and attitudes towards Generative AI and emphasize the importance of meta-cognitive skills to identify Generative AI.},

This early warning model uses deep learning technology, which can integrate various data from different channels, especially using graph neural networks to analyze social relationships between students, and add a special attention mechanism module to deal with time changes.The model's prediction accuracy rate reached 92.1%, which is much stronger than the old method.

  abstract = {This paper first conducts a regression analysis on the direct effect of artificial intelligence on the high-quality development of the manufacturing industry, and then uses the panel threshold model to explore the threshold effect of artificial intelligence on the high-quality development of the manufacturing industry. The Hausman test confirms the rationality of the fixed effect regression model, indicating that artificial intelligence has a significant positive impact on the high-quality development of the manufacturing industry. Subsequently, the panel threshold model is used for analysis, and it is found that there is a double threshold effect, with the first threshold value being 6.5575 and the second being 14.4800. The marginal effect of the improvement of artificial intelligence level on high-quality development shows a rapid increase at first, a slowdown after crossing the first threshold, and an acceleration again after crossing the second threshold. This nonlinear relationship is further verified through the adjustment ratio change and internal validity test for robustness. The results show that high-end and low-end manufacturing enterprises are more likely to benefit from artificial intelligence technology due to advantages in cost-effectiveness, market demand, and technological adaptability, thereby promoting their high-quality development. In contrast, mid-range manufacturing enterprises may face a series of challenges, resulting in less significant or even inhibitory effects of artificial intelligence technology on them.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) agents have infiltrated most aspects of our lives and the technologies we use, including social media. Content (and moderation thereof) on many popular social media platforms is currently a mix of human- and AI-generated. Depending on many technical, situational, and contextual factors, both human- and AI-generated content on social media platforms have the potential to either fuel or fight the stigmatization of marginalized groups. Stigmatization is the social process of stereotyping, devaluing, or marginalizing individuals or groups based on certain characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, religion, or race, which can lead to social exclusion and psychological damage. The impact of AI agents on either reinforcing or reducing existing stigmatization on social media platforms remains largely unknown within our scholarly community. We have even less understanding of how to design and implement AI agents that can actively help transform social media platforms into spaces for combating stigmatization while empowering marginalized groups. In this editorial, we call on the information systems (IS) community to conduct empirical, design, and theoretical research at the intersection of social media, specific AI systems or agents, and marginalized contexts. Advancing research in this space is critical to understanding and shaping the future of social media platforms as a social good and as places to reduce stigmatization.},

The research results show that this field has been in a stage of rapid development since 2019. Many scholars and institutions have participated and achieved rich research results. The research hotspots focus on big data analytics, management practices, and firm performance. In the future, the research of artificial intelligence in the field of supply chain resilience will move towards deep integration, practical application, predictive analysis, improve corporate competitiveness and develop in the direction of operational optimization and intelligence. However, due to possible issues such as uneven resource allocation, restricted knowledge exchange, and differences in research quality, many scholars and institutions are not very active in cooperation. In response to this, relevant departments should introduce targeted policies to encourage collaboration among scholars and institutions, such as providing funds for cooperative research and establishing cooperative research projects, in order to promote balanced resource distribution and extensive knowledge exchange.},

Use the Python language to crawl words related to "supply chain risk" in corporate annual reports, which are used to calculate the supply chain risk of enterprises. The fixed effects model and the intermediary effect model are used to empirically test the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in mitigating the supply chain risk. Through empirical research, we find that: AI plays an instrumental role in mitigating corporate supply chain risk. AI mitigates the supply chain risk by improving resource allocation efficiency of enterprises. The heterogeneity analysis shows that for enterprises in highly competitive industries, the mitigating effect of AI on the supply chain risk is more evident; in non-technology-oriented enterprises, the mitigating effect of artificial intelligence on supply chain risk is more significant.

However, despite the recent increase in research activity, age-relevant and inter/cross-generational aspects continue to be underrepresented in both research and commercial product design. Therefore, the overarching aim of this workshop is to increase the momentum for research within the space of hands-free, mobile, and conversational interfaces that centers on age-relevant and inter- and cross-generational interaction. For this, we plan to create an interdisciplinary space that brings together researchers, designers, practitioners, and users, to discuss and share challenges, principles, and strategies for designing such interfaces across the life span. We thus welcome contributions of empirical studies, theories, design, and evaluation of hands-free, mobile, and conversational interfaces designed with aging in mind (e.g. older adults or inter/cross-generational). We particularly encourage contributions focused on leveraging recent advances in generative AI or LLMs. Through this, we aim to grow the community of CUI researchers across disciplinary boundaries (human-computer interaction, voice and language technologies, geronto-technologies, information studies, etc.) that are engaged in the shared goal of ensuring that the aging dimension is appropriately incorporated in mobile / conversational interaction design research.},

The demand for low-skilled jobs is decreasing, while the demand for high-skilled jobs is increasing. This study selects labour market data for major economies from 2015 to 2024, and applies regression and cluster analysis to explore the intrinsic link between the degree of technology penetration and labour restructuring.The study finds that AI technologies have replaced around a quarter of low-skilled jobs in manufacturing, while at the same time high-skilled jobs such as data science and AI development have grown rapidly, further widening the skills gap. Moreover, the impact has varied significantly across countries and industries. Developed countries have experienced a massive loss of low-skill jobs and a dramatic increase in high-skill jobs, while developing countries have experienced similar trends, but with relatively smaller changes.Based on the above findings, the study makes a series of targeted policy recommendations, including strengthening vocational training, promoting industrial upgrading, improving the social security system, and enhancing the adaptability of the labour force, with the aim of mitigating the impact of AI on the employment structure and promoting the smooth development of the labour market.},

  abstract = {Audio-visual speech synthesis (AVSS) is a rapidly gaining prominence in artificial intelligence (AI) due to its widespread applications. AVSS refers to generating the audio-visual speech of a target speaker from the audio input of a source speaker, while preserving the speech content. The sequential steps of the AVSS process include voice conversion (VC) for altering vocal characteristics from the source to the target speaker and audio-visual synthesis (AVS) to generate a video stream from the converted speech of the target speaker. However, with the progressive development of deep generative models, the domain of AVSS remains relatively unexplored. The existing literature predominantly focuses on autoencoder-based AVSS models, potentially limiting their ability to capture the diversity of the vocal features and also synthesize the realistic video output. This paper introduces a novel AVSS approach utilizing a generative adversarial network (GAN) model, enriched with a capsule network (Caps-Net) architecture to effectively capture relevant input speech features and produce more natural audio-visual output. The proposed framework is trained and tested on VoxCeleb2 and LRS3-TED datasets and the experimental outcomes exhibit the superiority of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.},

Universities and enterprises are two important entities in the research and development (R&amp;D) activities of empowering vocational education with AI. Under the condition of bounded rationality, this paper constructs a university-enterprise evolutionary game model, studies the game interaction process between the two parties in different situations, and verifies the evolutionarily stable strategies through numerical simulation analysis. The results show that: The difference between supervision cost and non-supervision cost of universities, and the difference between high-quality R&amp;D cost and low-quality R&amp;D cost of enterprises are the key factors affecting the evolutionarily stable strategies of universities and enterprises respectively; Strengthening supervision of AI projects by government departments and all sectors of society can effectively promote supervision of universities and high-quality R&amp;D of enterprises; It is also an effective incentive method for universities to appropriately increase the government incentives allocated to enterprises.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a fundamental tool for cybersecurity researchers and practitioners. It is frequently used to address major security problems such as supply chain attacks, ransomware threats, and social engineering. In this context, integrating AI into cybersecurity workflows requires incorporating AI-driven approaches into the educational training of the cybersecurity workforce. This paradigm shift in academic settings will introduce the necessary skills for cybersecurity professionals to operate modern AI-based systems. Yet, the current cybersecurity curriculum still suffers from the absence of AI resources, particularly the detailed understanding of the appropriate AI mechanisms. Such absence leaves skill gaps for future professionals and practitioners in the industry. To address this, we designed an academic lecture module on AI covering both theory and practice. Then, we taught the module across six cybersecurity courses in our institution. To assess the effectiveness of integrating AI materials into cybersecurity education, we collected data by presenting two surveys before and after the lecture (concluding 81 participants per survey). Specifically, we utilized widely accepted models for unbiased analysis of our data. Our experimental results show positive AI knowledge improvement by 30% of the participants, demonstrating the beneficial impact of the lecture. Then, we observed a high similarity score between the survey responses and the lecture content, reaching 84%. Moreover, our sentiment analysis results reflect positive feedback from the participants with a positive score of 0.50. Overall, our study serves as a reference for instructional designers for developing educational curricula aiming to integrate AI into cybersecurity education.},

  abstract = {Modern AI systems are man-made objects that leverage machine learning to support our lives across a myriad of contexts and applications. Despite extensive epistemological and ethical debates, their metaphysical foundations remain relatively under explored. The orthodox view simply suggests that AI systems, as artifacts, lack well-posed identity and persistence conditions—their metaphysical kinds are no real kinds. In this work, we challenge this perspective by introducing a theory of metaphysical identity of AI systems. We do so by characterizing their kinds and introducing identity criteria—formal rules that answer the questions “When are two AI systems the same?” and “When does an AI system persist, despite change?” Building on Carrara and Vermaas’ account of fine-grained artifact kinds, we argue that AI trustworthiness provides a lens to understand AI system kinds and formalize the identity of these artifacts by relating their functional requirements to their physical make-ups. The identity criteria of AI systems are determined by their trustworthiness profiles—the collection of capabilities that the systems must uphold over time throughout their artifact histories, and their effectiveness in maintaining these capabilities. Our approach suggests that the identity and persistence of AI systems is sensitive to the socio-technical context of their design and utilization via their trustworthiness, providing a solid metaphysical foundation to the epistemological, ethical, and legal discussions about these artifacts.},

Despite the widespread use of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in assessments, the detection of AI cheating in MCQ-based tests has been almost unexplored, in contrast to the focus on detecting AI-cheating on text-rich student outputs. In this paper, we propose a method based on the application of Item Response Theory (IRT) to address this gap. Our approach operates on the assumption that artificial and human intelligence exhibit different response patterns, with AI cheating manifesting as deviations from the expected patterns of human responses. These deviations are modeled using Person-Fit Statistics (PFS). We demonstrate that this method effectively highlights the differences between human responses and those generated by premium versions of leading chatbots (ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini), but that it is also sensitive to the amount of AI cheating in the data. Furthermore, we show that the chatbots differ in their reasoning profiles. Our work provides both a theoretical foundation and empirical evidence for the application of IRT to identify AI cheating in MCQ-based assessments.},

We use data collected from interviews with immigrants discussing the Puente Hills Landfill Park design in Los Angeles, which will re-purpose a former landfill into a new public park. We use Dream Studio as a Design Probe, generating images from the interviewees’ insights and critically reflecting on the design process through internal interviews and a reflective workshop. We analyze our case in three domains: Opportunities, Risks and Challenges, and Features and Requirements. In the opportunities domain, we discuss how the enhanced translation of words to images changes the relationship between stakeholder engagement, multiplicity, and efficiency. In the risks and challenges domain, we discuss how IGAI might enhance power imbalances and biases. Finally, we reflect on what features would ease the safe and responsible use of IGAI to engage citizens in co-designing public parks.},

  abstract = {People often apply gender stereotypes to Artificial Intelligence (AI), and AI design frequently reinforces these stereotypes, perpetuating traditional gender ideologies in state-of-the-art technology. Despite growing interests in investigating this phenomenon, there is little conceptual clarity or consistency regarding what actually constitutes a "gender stereotype" in AI. Therefore, it is critical to provide a more comprehensive image of existing understandings and ongoing discussions of gender stereotypes of AI to guide AI design that reduces the harmful effects of these stereotypes. In doing so, this paper presents a scoping review of over 20 years of research across HCI, HRI and various social science disciplines on how gender stereotypes are applied to AI. We outline the methods and contexts of this growing body of work, develop a typology to clarify these stereotypes, highlight under-explored approaches for future research, and offer guidelines to improve rigor and consistency in this field that may inform responsible AI design in the future.},

  abstract = {Generative AI has the potential to transform how public services are delivered by enhancing productivity and reducing time spent on bureaucracy. But to what extent is the technology already in use? Our survey of UK public service professionals (in education, health, social work, and emergency services) seeks to answer this question. We find that use of generative AI is widespread: 45% of respondents were aware of colleagues using generative AI, while 22% use it themselves. Respondents were positive about its potential to enhance their efficiency and reduce their bureaucratic workload. For example, those working in the health service thought that time spent on bureaucracy could drop by the equivalent of one day per week, an enormous potential impact. Our survey also found a high amount of trust (61%) in generative AI and a low fear of replacement (16%). However, only a minority of respondents (32%) felt like there was clear guidance on generative AI usage in their workplaces. In other words, it is clear that generative AI is already coming into the public sector, but uptake is happening in a disorganised fashion without clear guidelines. The UK’s public sector urgently needs to develop more systematic methods for taking advantage of the technology.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for natural language understanding and text generation. An LLM model relies on a time-consuming step called LLM decoding to generate output tokens. Several prior works focus on improving the performance of LLM decoding using parallelism techniques, such as batching and speculative decoding. State-of-the-art LLM decoding has both compute-bound and memory-bound kernels. Some prior works statically identify and map these different kernels to a heterogeneous architecture consisting of both processing-in-memory (PIM) units and computation-centric accelerators (e.g., GPUs). We observe that characteristics of LLM decoding kernels (e.g., whether or not a kernel is memory-bound) can change dynamically due to parameter changes to meet user and/or system demands, making (1) static kernel mapping to PIM units and computation-centric accelerators suboptimal, and (2) one-size-fits-all approach of designing PIM units inefficient due to a large degree of heterogeneity even in memory-bound kernels.In this paper, we aim to accelerate LLM decoding while considering the dynamically changing characteristics of the kernels involved. We propose PAPI (PA rallel Decoding with PI M), a PIM-enabled heterogeneous architecture that exploits dynamic scheduling of compute-bound or memory-bound kernels to suitable hardware units. PAPI has two key mechanisms: (1) online kernel characterization to dynamically schedule kernels to the most suitable hardware units at runtime and (2) a PIM-enabled heterogeneous computing system that harmoniously orchestrates both computation-centric processing units (GPU) and hybrid PIM units with different computing capabilities. Our experimental results on three broadly-used LLMs (i.e., LLaMA-65B, GPT-3 66B, and GPT-3 175B) show that PAPI achieves 1.8\texttimes{} and 11.1\texttimes{} speedups over a state-of-the-art heterogeneous LLM accelerator (i.e., GPU and PIM) and a state-of-the-art PIM-only LLM accelerator, respectively.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the ethical implications of integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings, from primary schools to universities, while drawing insights from ancient Greek philosophy to address emerging concerns. As AI technologies increasingly influence learning environments, they offer novel opportunities for personalized learning, efficient assessment, and data-driven decision-making. However, these advancements also raise critical ethical questions regarding data privacy, algorithmic bias, student autonomy, and the changing roles of educators. This research examines specific use cases of AI in education, analyzing both their potential benefits and drawbacks. By revisiting the philosophical principles of ancient Greek thinkers such as Socrates, Aristotle, and Plato, we discuss how their writings can guide the ethical implementation of AI in modern education. The paper argues that while AI presents significant challenges, a balanced approach informed by classical philosophical thought can lead to an ethically sound transformation of education. It emphasizes the evolving role of teachers as facilitators and the importance of fostering student initiative in AI-rich environments.},

We present a new perspective on IR research in which the users of an IR system are intelligent agents instead of human users. Extending the current work on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), we identify five novel IR tasks that an intelligent agent must be able to perform in order to achieve Human-Level Artificial Intelligence, or Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), including 1) External Information Retrieval (EIR) to access new information unseen by the agent, 2) Provenance Information Retrieval (PIR) to trace the provenance of information, 3) Curriculum Information Retrieval (CIR) to actively acquire the most useful new data and information for lifelong learning, 4) Rule Information Retrieval (RIR) to perform reasoning and problem solving, and 5) Scenario Information Retrieval (SIR) to leverage past scenarios for problem solving and decision making. We compare these new IR tasks with the traditional IR tasks performed by an IR system that serves human users and systematically examine the challenges involved in the five new IR tasks, providing a roadmap for new IR research within the broader context of AGI development.},

However, learning SDLC concepts presents unique challenges, such as the need for effective collaboration, real-time interaction, and access to diverse skill sets represented in software development teams. To address these problems, we present DevCoach, a generative AI powered multi-agent system designed to support students learning the SDLC. DevCoach allows students to interact with generative AI agents simulating the different roles in the software development team, engaging in tasks across different phases of SDLC. Through a user study (n = 20), we evaluate the system's effectiveness in enhancing learning, impact on SDLC deliverables, and support for Community of Inquiry (CoI) elements necessary for effective and supportive learning environments. Our results reveal that students using DevCoach achieved significantly higher learning gains and improved task completion rates across all SDLC phases. The system also supports CoI elements, particularly perceived social presence. Participants also lauded the immediate context-aware feedback, interactive learning environment, and diverse expertise provided by the roles within the multi-agent team. These findings demonstrate the potential of generative AI to enhance software engineering education by making it more effective, engaging, and interactive, providing students with collaborative and practical learning experiences.},

Utilizing available data such as satellite imagery, sensor data, and social media, alongside data mining and big data analytics, can significantly enhance disaster management efforts. However, timely access to these often fragmented and incomplete data presents challenges. Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, including machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing, offer solutions by enabling faster response times for government agencies, NGOs, and other authorities. This research examines 72 studies on the application of AI in various stages of disaster management, including the simulation, detection, prediction, and handling of post-disaster situations. AI-based systems improve the issuance of early warnings, streamline risk communication, optimize relief logistics, and support evacuation plans while also aiding in the decision-making processes for the issuance of building permits and grants. The analysis highlights the transformative potential of AI across all disaster management phases, from preparedness and response to prevention/mitigation and recovery, and identifies future challenges in this domain. In conclusion, the study underscores the power of AI not only in forecasting the occurrence and impact zones of disasters but also in identifying the most vulnerable communities and assessing the viability of disaster response strategies.},

By leveraging the strengths of both, a synergy between the two can achieve integrated intelligence. The collaboration between AI and teachers in teaching addresses the shortcomings of relying solely on either AI or human teachers, forming a complex system that combines their respective advantages. Therefore, it is crucial to clarify the futures of AI and teacher for collaborative teaching. Additionally, it discusses four types of collaborative processes supported by AI-teacher teaching systems, analyzing how data circulation and utilization can be enhanced through the four stages of data production, data transformation, data application, and data feedback. Finally, a Chinese language class supported by AI-teacher collaboration was conducted and implemented in a base school in a certain city for sixth-grade students, to analyze the key elements and operational mechanisms in the human-machine collaborative classroom, providing theoretical and practical references for AI-teacher collaborative teaching.},

  abstract = {The convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and higher education is revolutionising the paradigm of traditional teaching and learning, this paper proposes a novel framework on top of previous research by means of an advanced dialogue system empowered by attentional mechanisms in the field of Artificial Intelligence in which an AI-driven dialogue agent dynamically evaluates student responses over multiple interactions,using attentional mechanisms to identify key semantic patterns, from conceptual comprehension to logical coherence.The system calibrates student responses through iterative scoring and averaging to build adaptive learner profiles that accurately categorise students into five levels at different proficiency levels (e.g., introductory, basic, intermediate, advanced, proficient).In addition to automated assessment, this approach facilitates personalised learning interventions: high-achieving students receive tailored resources for intellectual development, while students with learning difficulties receive targeted remediation through micro-lessons curated by AI. Technological innovations include a hybrid architecture combining a bi-directional GRU network with a context-aware attention layer optimised to detect subtle awareness gaps in open academic discourse.As higher education struggles to respond to the needs of a mass and diverse learner population, this research highlights how AI's dual role as an analytical tool and instructional partner transforms classrooms into responsive ecosystems where every conversation shapes tomorrow's learning trajectory.},

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Google Bard, have performed interestingly well when assisting developers on computer programming tasks, a.k.a., coding, thus potentially resulting in convenient and faster software constructions. This new approach significantly enhances efficiency but also presents challenges in unsupervised code construction with limited security guarantees. LLMs excel in producing code with accurate grammar, yet they are not specifically trained to guarantee the security of the code. In this paper, we provide an initial exploration into using formal software specifications as a starting point for software construction, allowing developers to translate descriptions of security-related behavior into natural language instructions for LLMs, a.k.a., prompts. In addition, we leveraged automated verification tools to evaluate the code produced against the aforementioned specifications , following a modular, step-by-step software construction process. For our study, we leveraged Role-based Access Control (RBAC), a mature security model, and the Java Modeling Language (JML), a behavioral specification language for Java. We test our approach on different publicly-available LLMs, namely, OpenAI ChatGPT 4.0, Google Bard, and Microsoft CoPilot. We provide a description of two applications-a security-sensitive Banking application employing RBAC and an RBAC API module itself-, the corresponding JML specifications, as well as a description of the prompts, the generated code, the verification results, as well as a series of interesting insights for practitioners interested in further exploring the use of LLMs for securely constructing applications.},

Many critical applications can be formulated as graph-based tasks, and graph machine learning (GML), from the shallow embedding models to graph neural networks and further advanced to the most powerful graph transformers, has been well-established to automate knowledge discovery and decision-making on graphs. In parallel, the recent emergence of large foundational models has driven machine learning into a new era of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI), and this revolution presents both unprecedented opportunities and profound challenges for the well-established GML paradigms. However, few investigations have analyzed and envisioned how GML should evolve to harness these opportunities, address these challenges, and embrace this new Gen-AI era. To fill in this gap, we organize the first international Workshop on Machine Learning on Graphs in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence (MLoG-GenAI), held in connection with the 31st ACM Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, which provides a venue to gather academic researchers and industry practitioners to discuss and picture the development of GML in the new Gen-AI era.},

  abstract = {This study analyzed how students used generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools in collaborative problem solving. We examined students’ GAI usage using conversational data and screen recordings from 12 groups, each comprising three university students. A coding framework was developed through hybrid thematic analysis to capture students’ GAI use behaviors at both individual and group levels. Four types of behaviors were identified: prompting, information sharing, information use, and evaluation. Based on this framework, we conducted a correlation analysis to examine how these behaviors were related to students’ knowledge construction. The results showed that GAI use behaviors involving sharing or comparing responses were correlated with lower levels of knowledge construction, whereas behaviors involving co-editing and evaluating were correlated with higher levels. This study contributes a new framework for analyzing individual and collective use of GAI in collaborative learning and offers pedagogical insights that guide students’ effective use of GAI tools in teaching practice.},

However, it remains underexplored how GenAI chatbots influence visitors’ in-field experience and interaction at art museums regarding finding information, engagement, and enjoyment compared to existing museum tour-guide applications. In this paper, we contribute the design and implementation of a smartphone-based chatbot that detects artwork, generates textual and auditory information, and interactively answers visitors’ questions. To explore visitors’ experience with it, we conducted a field experiment (N=30) at the National Art Museum, comparing it to the existing museum application. Our results indicate that visitors showed higher artwork engagement with the chatbot than the museum application. Moreover, they enjoyed an interactive experience using the chatbot to learn about the art collection and have equally preferred textual and auditory information representation.},

  abstract = {It has recently emerged that generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been significantly developed and can create realistic speech, images, and video. Although such innovations provide many advantages, they pose major threats to the network's security. The research question of the study will, therefore, be the role and effects of generative artificial intelligence on network security, especially deepfake, artificial intelligence-driven phishing, and multimedia content manipulation. This research uses a case study analysis of real-life experiences of security threats in networked systems to show how generative AI can be misused. The findings reveal that: 1. Generative AI can create highly developed cyberattacks such as deepfake social engineering and AI-supplemented phishing, which use visually and audibly persuasive appeals to manipulate users. 2. The problem with this kind of security threat highlighted by AI is that most traditional security solutions lack awareness of such threats since they are incapable of effective real-time user authentication, over-dependence on visual and biometric verification, and lack of AI-awareness training. 3. There are significant gaps in cybersecurity policies and training. Many organizations lack formal protocols for addressing AI-related security risks, and often, organizations are applying generative AI technologies. In addressing the aforementioned vulnerabilities, the study recommends an improved security model that incorporates deepfake detection, more secure authentication, and even advanced anomaly detection systems. In furtherance, there should be improvements in policy that aim at commanding the AI media, ensuring comprehensive training of the employees on cybersecurity matters, and drives that aim at educating the public on how to enhance the strength for discouraging AI cybercrimes.},

In this study, we demonstrate a novel application of GenAI for epidemic modeling. We employed GenAI for creating agents living in a hypothetical town in simulations and simulating their behavior within the context of an ongoing pandemic. We performed a series of simulations to quantify the impact of agent traits and the availability of information for health condition, virus, and government guidelines on the disease spread patterns in terms of peak time and epidemic duration. We also characterized the most influential factors in agents' decision-making using random forest model.},

  abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems bring innovative ways of information provision and knowledge delivery. In the public sector, generative AI has the potential to decrease bureaucratic discretion in the decision-making process. Increasing reliance on this technology brings challenges of unfair treatment, colonized responses from the system, and data governance. Because of historical interaction, tribal communities are the most underrepresented in policy planning and implementation. Indigenous communities suffer from the neglect of tribal sovereignty by the U.S. federal government and limited accessibility and literacy in the digital world. Generative AI systems exacerbate these challenges with insufficient tribal input. However, the negative impact can be alleviated with digital equity and knowledge cocreation. Digital equity emphasizes the importance of tribal knowledge representation, and knowledge cocreation focuses on the collaboration between Indigenous communities and relevant actors in data governance for generative AI systems. This study proposes two research questions to discuss tribal knowledge cocreation in generative AI systems: (1) what are the biases in the system responses from the tribal perspective? (2) what are the potential resolutions for these problems? The findings from in-depth interviews with tribal members in the U.S. indicate that the insufficient articulation of tribal culture, the lack of crucial tribal historical events, and the inappropriate appellation of tribal nations are the primary drawbacks in the system responses. From the Indigenous perspective, tribal oral traditions, native publications and documents, and collaboration with tribal governments can address the problems of generative AI responses. This study contributes to the theory development of digital equity and knowledge cocreation in tribal generative AI system responses. Policy recommendations and future research agendas are included in this research.},

This alteration underlines the necessity to look into how AI can enhance ethics education for the youth. This research reveals that the capabilities of GAI match up well with the requirements of youth ethics education in four principal ways: (1) crafting immersive, multi-sensory scenarios to boost student interest. By creating such scenarios, students can get more engaged and excited about learning. (2) Employing adaptive methods for precise interventions. This means being able to adjust the teaching approach according to each student's specific situation to make the intervention more effective. (3) Generating personalized content to customize the delivery of knowledge. Every student is different, and personalized content can better meet their individual learning needs. (4) Offering real-time analysis to improve teaching methods. With real-time analysis, teachers can quickly understand how students are doing and make timely adjustments. Based on these connections, this study puts forward a framework that incorporates GAI into crucial parts of the teaching process: integrating comprehensive learning data. This helps to have a more complete understanding of students' learning progress. Developing evidence-based strategies. So that teaching decisions are made with solid evidence. Creating differentiated content. To cater to the diverse needs of students. And assessing outcomes in multiple dimensions.

  abstract = {Context-aware AR instruction enables adaptive and in-situ learning experiences. However, hardware limitations and expertise requirements constrain the creation of such instructions. With recent developments in Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI), current research tries to tackle these constraints by deploying AI-generated content (AIGC) in AR applications. However, our preliminary study with six AR practitioners revealed that the current AIGC lacks contextual information to adapt to varying application scenarios and is therefore limited in authoring. To utilize the strong generative power of GenAI to ease the authoring of AR instruction while capturing the context, we developed CARING-AI, an AR system to author context-aware humanoid-avatar-based instructions with GenAI. By navigating in the environment, users naturally provide contextual information to generate humanoid-avatar animation as AR instructions that blend in the context spatially and temporally. We showcased three application scenarios of CARING-AI: Asynchronous Instructions, Remote Instructions, and Ad Hoc Instructions based on a design space of AIGC in AR Instructions. With two user studies (N=12), we assessed the system usability of CARING-AI and demonstrated the easiness and effectiveness of authoring with Gen-AI.},

By leveraging multiple sensory channels, multimodal feedback better accommodates diverse learning preferences and aids in deeper information retention. Despite its potential, creating multimodal feedback poses challenges, including the need for increased time and resources. Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offer solutions to automate the feedback process, predominantly focusing on textual feedback. Yet, the application of GenAI in generating multimodal feedback remains largely unexplored. Our study investigates the use of GenAI techniques to generate multimodal feedback, aiming to provide this feedback for large cohorts of learners, thereby enhancing learning experience and engagement.

  abstract = {Generative AI models have revolutionized intelligent systems by enabling machines to produce human-like content across diverse domains. However, their outputs often exhibit unpredictability due to complex and opaque internal semantic states, posing challenges for reliability in real-world applications. In this article, we introduce the AI Uncertainty Principle, a novel theoretical framework inspired by quantum mechanics, to model and quantify the inherent unpredictability in generative AI outputs. By drawing parallels with the uncertainty principle and superposition, we formalize the tradeoff between the precision of internal semantic states and output variability. Through comprehensive experiments involving state-of-the-art models and a variety of prompt designs, we analyze how factors such as specificity, complexity, tone, and style influence model behavior. Our results demonstrate that carefully engineered prompts can significantly enhance output predictability and consistency, while excessive complexity or irrelevant information can increase uncertainty. We also show that ensemble techniques, such as Sigma-weighted aggregation across models and prompt variations, effectively improve reliability. Our findings have profound implications for the development of intelligent systems, emphasizing the critical role of prompt engineering and theoretical modeling in creating AI technologies that perceive, reason, and act predictably in the real world.},

  abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is fundamentally changing the ways of working and blurring the boundaries between human and machine-generated contents. While there is an increasing interest in the adoption of GAI systems, such as ChatGPT and DALL-E, there are also serious concerns about the copyright of the contents—the inputs or generated as outputs by the GAI systems. Such concerns need to be identified and assessed to ensure the ethical and responsible use of GAI systems. Thus, this article aims to address the key research challenge: “how to identify and assess GAI system's copyright concerns”? In response, we propose the development of a Copyright Risk Checker (CRC) Tool. This tool has been formulated and evaluated using a recognised design science research methodology, drawing on an analysis of 10 legal cases across Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Europe. The CRC Tool has undergone evaluation through an experimental scenario, and the results suggest that it is suitable for conducting an indicative copyright risk check of GAI systems. The outcomes of this preliminary assessment can be further examined by expert legal advisors for an in-depth analysis. The development of the CRC Tool provides a foundation for continued research and advancement in this significant area of study.},

  abstract = {Mathematical stories have demonstrated the ability to bolster the motivation and interest of students in learning mathematics, thereby exerting a positive influence on their academic performance. However, due to a lack of adequate resources and the desire to engage students in the creation process, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is utilized to generate mathematical stories accompanied by images. This study presents a framework for automatic quality assessment to evaluate the coherence of multimodal text and images generated by GAI, as well as the appropriateness of the stories for different grade levels. The dataset comprises mathematical stories generated by GAI for grades 3, 4, and 5, obtained from an American online learning platform, each story consisting of titles, bodies, and image illustrations generated by GP4, images generated by DALL-E3. Initially, a method is devised based on CLIP model and Mini-GPT4 for extracting multimodal semantic features to establish the relationship between text and images in mathematical stories and their generation parameters. Subsequently, mathematical text features are designed, including nine mathematical text attributes and ten traditional text readability indicators, followed by collinearity feature selection and statistical testing. Finally, five machine learning grade regressor for mathematical stories were trained, and the correlation between these 19 features and grades is explored using genetic algorithm-based factor mining and the interpretable artificial intelligence method SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). To further understand advanced text features, the latest natural language processing (NLP) readability indicators are also integrated into the analysis. Through multimodal features, traditional text readability metrics, and NLP readability indicators, this method introduces a novel approach for automatically assessing the quality of GAI-generated multimodal mathematical stories, providing a tool for grade predictor and shedding light on the factors (Image-text relevance and textual features) influencing the grade level of analyzed stories, thereby offering new insights for leveraging GAI in mathematical education.},

Data was collected from Finnish high school students to represent how key constructs of the Technology Acceptance Model—Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, Perceived Enjoyment, and Intention to Use—influence the adoption of AI tools. First, a structural equation model for a comparative study with a prior study was constructed and analyzed. Then, an extended model with the additional construct of Compatibility, which represents the alignment of AI tools with students' educational experiences and needs, was proposed and analyzed. The results demonstrated a strong influence of perceived usefulness on the intention to use GenAI, emphasizing the statistically significant role of perceived enjoyment in determining perceived usefulness and ease of use. The inclusion of compatibility improved the model's explanatory power, particularly in predicting perceived usefulness. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of how AI tools can be integrated into mathematics education and highlights key differences between the Finnish educational context and previous studies based on structural equation modeling.},

In order to explore how to improve undergraduate students' ability to cope with information security threats brought about by generative artificial intelligence, this paper constructs a theoretical model for improving undergraduate students' information security behaviour in the context of generative artificial intelligence by integrating the theory of protective motivation, the theory of planned behaviour, and the theory of social cognition. Based on 354 questionnaire survey data, this study systematically analyses the influencing factors and mechanisms of undergraduate students' information security in the context of generative artificial intelligence. The results show that perceived threat, subjective norms and self-efficacy have a positive influence on students' information security behaviour intention, which in turn has a positive influence on their information security behaviour implementation, with environmental support playing a moderating role between the two. The findings of the study help to further improve the theoretical model of undergraduate students' information security behaviour in the context of artificial intelligence, and at the same time provide valuable insights for education departments and colleges and universities to take effective measures to improve undergraduate students' information security capabilities in the era of generating artificial intelligence.},

While ensuring accuracy and completeness, the quality of the responses was improved by the merge of students' queries with relevant texts using RAG technology. Regarding implementation, RAG technology consists of knowledge base construction and knowledge retrieval. It includes segmenting the document, recognizing and vectorizing it in order to build a vector database. During user retrieval, queries are sorted through the vector database interface, and the matched knowledge fragments and query statements are merged to generate answers including specific domain knowledge.

  abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools are now used by students to do their learning assessment, thus impairing the value of such learning assessment. For open education learners who aim to just obtain adult education diplomas, particularly, the cost of learning assessment is becoming increasingly low due to the use of generative AI. How to instructional design and assessment for open education learners in the era of generative AI becomes therefore an issue requiring urgent solutions. From such perspectives as the advantages and disadvantages of generative AI, the learning needs and characteristics of open education learners, and the new characteristics of learning assessment with the use of generative AI, this paper examines the dilemma of instructional design and assessment during the age of generative AI, puts forward the ideas and models for the design of homework for open education learners, and makes learning assessment design proposals with respect to renewing the methods of learning assessment, improving the AI literacy of both teachers and students, etc., with a view to offering some insight for the design of homework in the era of generative AI.},

  abstract = {Generative AI changes the paradigm of natural language processing research, sets off a new trend of research in computational humanities and computational social sciences, and provides unique perspectives on digital intelligence-enabled ancient book revitalization and intelligent applications. The article explores the role of multimodal large models in image processing and OCR of ancient books. We discuss and exemplify how to use Large Language Models for intelligent information processing of ancient texts and explore combining prompt engineering, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), supervised fine-tuning, LangChain, and other techniques to improve performance in ancient text mining and applications. This article also looks forward to the broad prospect of intelligent agent technology combined with the Large Language Model in the innovative application of ancient book revitalization. The research focuses on digitizing ancient books, intelligent processing of ancient texts, and intelligent application of ancient book revitalization. It demonstrates the feasibility, advancement, and creativity of the application of generative AI and its derivative technologies in the field of computational humanities, especially in the field of ancient book preservation, to provide intelligent solutions for the dissemination of traditional thought and culture, from the perspective of the whole process of the technology of digital humanities and computational humanities research. The article also gives examples of the intelligent application of AI in the restoration of ancient books and the annotation of ancient texts. Although Large Language Models demonstrate transformative potential in advancing the field of ancient text research toward intelligent analysis, there remain certain limitations. This article points out their shortcomings in areas such as knowledge completion for ancient texts, understanding emotions and cultural nuances, as well as ethical and accountability issues. It emphasizes the need for a more balanced perspective on the role that generative AI plays in the exploration and utilization of cultural heritage.},

  abstract = {The ongoing integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) within higher education (HE) signifies a pivotal shift in pedagogical paradigms, demanding comprehensive theoretical and practical considerations. This paper critically examines the multifaceted adoption of GenAI in HE by reviewing interdisciplinary theoretical frameworks from psychology, computer science, and pedagogy. It highlights the insufficiency of traditional technology acceptance models, which predominantly address cognitive and rational decision-making processes, and advocates for the inclusion of emotional and ethical dimensions often overlooked in existing frameworks. By synthesizing research across various disciplines, this review identifies significant gaps and proposes an integrated theoretical model to effectively understand and guide GenAI adoption. The proposed framework emphasizes the need for robust, empirically supported methodologies that accommodate the complex, dynamic nature of GenAI applications. This paper not only contributes to academic discourse by providing a comprehensive review of existing literature but also sets a foundation for future empirical studies aimed at refining GenAI integration strategies in HE, ensuring they are ethically aligned and educationally effective.},

Leveraging large language models (LLMs), CS50.ai offers a suite of AI-based tools that assist both students and instructors in mastering course material while overcoming the limitations posed by human resource constraints. This demo highlights how generative AI can be employed to conduct code reviews and pair-programming simulations, providing real-time feedback, code explanations, and collaborative programming insights. By integrating these AI tools into students' learning journeys, we aim to mimic the 1:1 interaction between instructor and student, improving both formative and summative assessments. We will showcase how these tools are implemented to scale personalized feedback, ensure academic integrity, and maintain pedagogical efficacy. Our presentation will also reflect on lessons learned from deploying these AI-driven tools in recent course offerings.},

  abstract = {This study examines policy interventions and regulation of generative artificial intelligence (AI), focusing on key differences in generative AI policy in the EU, the US, and China. Using a comparative research methodology, the study analyzed the most recent policy documents from these regions through text-mining techniques to assess their key differences in terms of word frequency and specific content. This work highlights the different strategies, goals, and approaches to regulating generative AI across the regions. It found that the EU adopts a more comprehensive and stringent regulation of generative AI, emphasizing regional harmonization and foresight; the U.S. regulation is characterized by pragmatism, closely aligned with industry innovation, and a focus on risk avoidance; while China focuses more on macro-level regulation aimed at promoting innovation and encouraging ecological construction.Participants may be interested in this study because it not only uses up-to-date materials but also employs text-mining methods to present the findings in a clearer way than previous studies. It provides insights into how regulatory policies for generative AI affect the development and practice of digital government. The study sheds light on different countries’ strategies for technology governance, which is crucial for understanding and designing effective digital government policies. In addition, due to the potential of generative AI technologies to deliver public services and drive government transparency, these insights help participants better assess the opportunities and challenges of technological innovation in the digital government space.},

  abstract = {In computer-based learning environments (CBLEs), adopting effective self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies requires sophisticated coordination of multiple SRL processes. While various studies have proposed adaptive SRL scaffolds (i.e. real-time advice on adopting effective SRL processes) and embedded them in CBLEs to facilitate learners’ effective use of SRL strategies, two key research gaps remain. First, there is a lack of research on SRL scaffolds that are based on continuous assessment of both learners’ SRL processes and learning conditions (e.g., awareness of learning resources) to provide adaptive support. Second, current analytics-based scaffolding mechanisms lack the scalability needed to effectively address multiple learning conditions. Integration of analytics of SRL with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can provide scalable scaffolding for real-time SRL processes and evolving conditions. Yet, empirical studies implementing and evaluating effects of this integration remain scarce. To address these limitations, we conducted a randomized control trial, assigning participants to three groups (control, process only, and process with condition groups) to investigate the effects of using GenAI to turn insights from real-time analytics about students’ SRL processes and conditions into adaptive scaffolds. The results demonstrate that integrating real-time analytics with GenAI in adaptive SRL scaffolds – addressing both SRL processes and dynamic conditions – promotes more metacognitive learning patterns compared to the control and process-only groups. In addition, the learners showed varying levels of compliance with analytics-based GenAI scaffolds, and this was also reflected in how the learners coordinated their SRL processes, particularly in the performance phase of SRL. This study contributes to the literature by designing, implementing, and evaluating the impact of adaptive scaffolds on learners’ SRL processes using real-time analytics with GenAI.},

The analysis results show that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use have significant positive effects on university teachers' acceptance of generative AI. Self-efficacy, technical efficiency, organizational AI readiness and environmental support have significant positive effects on perceived usefulness. Self-efficacy, organizational AI readiness and environmental support have significant positive effects on perceived ease of use, and technical complexity has a significant negative effect. Furthermore, self-efficacy, technical efficiency, technical complexity, organizational AI readiness, and environmental support do not work independently but synergistically through different combinations, and there are three types of configurations of individual initiative type, system incubation type, and bilateral engagement type. The results of this research can help to further enrich the theoretical system of generative AI application in education, and can also provide practice suggestions for teachers, universities, and education management departments to take effective measures to enhance the acceptance of generative AI in higher education.},

In this study, a multimodal sentiment analysis framework based on generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology is proposed, aiming at automatically identifying the emotional tendency in online product marketing information. By combining the latest generative AI technology, the model can not only analyze the direct feedback from users, but also capture the potential emotional color. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional single-modal sentiment analysis method, the accuracy of the proposed multimodal model is improved by 15\%, and the recall rate is improved by 12\%. This shows that the model can provide more accurate market insight for enterprises, and help to better understand customer needs, improve product design and optimize marketing strategies. The demonstrated multimodal sentiment analysis framework provides a powerful tool for understanding and responding to consumer sentiment. Future research will further explore how to enhance the generalization ability of the model and how to deal with emotional differences in cross-cultural background more effectively to achieve a wider application in the global scope.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), exemplified by ChatGPT, Midjourney, and other state-of-the-art large language models and diffusion models, holds significant potential for transforming education and enhancing human productivity. While the prevalence of GenAI in education has motivated numerous research initiatives, integrating these technologies within the learning analytics (LA) cycle and their implications for practical interventions remain underexplored. This paper delves into the prospective opportunities and challenges GenAI poses for advancing LA. We present a concise overview of the current GenAI landscape and contextualise its potential roles within Clow’s generic framework of the LA cycle. We posit that GenAI can play pivotal roles in analysing unstructured data, generating synthetic learner data, enriching multimodal learner interactions, advancing interactive and explanatory analytics, and facilitating personalisation and adaptive interventions. As the lines blur between learners and GenAI tools, a renewed understanding of learners is needed. Future research can delve deep into frameworks and methodologies that advocate for human-AI collaboration. The LA community can play a pivotal role in capturing data about human and AI contributions and exploring how they can collaborate most effectively.

There is limited prior research on computing students' use and perceptions of GenAI. In anticipation of future advances and evolutions of GenAI, we capture a snapshot of student attitudes towards and uses of yet emerging GenAI, in a period of time before university policies had reacted to these technologies. We surveyed all computer science majors in a small engineering-focused R1 university in order to: (1) capture a baseline assessment of how GenAI has been immediately adopted by aspiring computer scientists; (2) describe computing students' GenAI-related needs and concerns for their education and careers; and (3) discuss GenAI influences on CS pedagogy, curriculum, culture, and policy. We present an exploratory qualitative analysis of this data and discuss the impact of our findings on the emerging conversation around GenAI and education.},

Through the bibliometric and content analysis methods, together with the CiteSpace tool, highlight the trending application of this technology in education, the distribution characteristics of the core authors and institutions' postings, and the clustering analysis of the research hotspots. The results show continued wide adoption of generative AI technology in education in recent years, peaking sharply in 2023. There hasn't been a stable core group of authors within the field, and the collaborative network is relatively sparse. Research hotspots mainly cover artificial intelligence, human-computer collaboration and educational transformation, which indicates the function generative AI technology could have within the digital transformation and quality enhancement of education. This paper additionally shows the actualization of generative AI technology through its presentation of AI tutors and teaching assistants, teaching models reform, and reshaped instructional evaluation systems via case studies. In face of misuse, integrity issues, and ethical concerns arising, there is a need to find a balance in the application of the technology, such that its more proper development can promote rather than replace human subjectivity.},

This study focuses on the behavioral intentions of elementary and secondary school teachers to use generative artificial intelligence (AIGC) to assist their teaching and its influencing factors. Based on the Integration Technology Acceptance Model (UTAUT), we analyzed the influence of factors such as performance expectations, effort expectations, social influences, and enabling conditions on primary and secondary school teachers' use of AIGC. Through questionnaire survey and data analysis, it was found that these factors have a significant effect on teachers' use of AIGC and that there are significant differences in teachers' personal characteristics such as teaching experience, gender and IT proficiency in terms of behavioral intention. In order to enhance teachers' intention to use AIGC, it is recommended to strengthen teachers' skill training, improve the quality of AIGC products, and optimize the smart teaching environment and application planning in schools.},

These tools were initially available to approximately 70 summer students, then to thousands of students online, and finally to several hundred on campus during Fall 2023. Per the course's own policy, we encouraged students to use these course-specific tools and limited the use of commercial AI software such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and the new Bing. Our goal was to approximate a 1:1 teacher-to-student ratio through software, thereby equipping students with a pedagogically-minded subject-matter expert by their side at all times, designed to guide students toward solutions rather than offer them outright. The tools were received positively by students, who noted that they felt like they had "a personal tutor.'' Our findings suggest that integrating AI thoughtfully into educational settings enhances the learning experience by providing continuous, customized support and enabling human educators to address more complex pedagogical issues. In this paper, we detail how AI tools have augmented teaching and learning in CS50, specifically in explaining code snippets, improving code style, and accurately responding to curricular and administrative queries on the course's discussion forum. Additionally, we present our methodological approach, implementation details, and guidance for those considering using these tools or AI generally in education.},

This study presents a 'Three-Tier Three-Driver' personalized teaching reform model that categorizes students into three tiers based on different career trajectories and leverages AI as a driver across three dimensions: teaching content, teaching methods, and assessment.Multiple AI tools and methods like AI teaching assistants, GPT models, knowledge graph construction, Q&amp;A modules, and AI assessment modules are used by the course to design the entire curriculum anew, boost pedagogical practice, and reconstruct assessment schemes.Data were collected from a questionnaire survey with 500 students and were modeled using K-Means clustering, DBSCAN density-based clustering algorithms and random forest models. Results demonstrate significant differences in student behaviors and perceptions related to AI tool usage across the different clusters.Effective use of AI technologies was found to benefit student satisfaction and academic performance. Furthermore, there was a significant association found between AI use times and course satisfaction, however DBSCAN could not detect a group of extreme learners.The study concludes by compiling replicable evidence of AI-driven teaching innovation and discussing existing limitations (such as the limited sample scope) as well as possible directions for future work.The conclusion uncovers GAI-empowered teaching innovation as a good promise for teaching quality improvement and personalized learning promotion for postgraduate education.},

A key question, then, is whether people believe news headlines generated by AI as much as news headlines generated by humans. AI is viewed as lacking human motives and emotions, suggesting that people might view news written by AI as more accurate. By contrast, two pre-registered experiments on representative U.S. samples (N = 4,034) showed that people rated news headlines written by AI as less accurate than those written by humans. People were more likely to incorrectly rate news headlines written by AI (vs. a human) as inaccurate when they were actually true, and more likely to correctly rate them as inaccurate when they were indeed false. Our findings are important given the increasing adoption of AI in news generation, and the associated ethical and governance pressures to disclose it use and address standards of transparency and accountability.},

Both physical and digital prototypes are commonly adopted by designers to support ideation and creativity, providing intuitive perception and rapid iteration, respectively. In recent advancements, large-scale generation models are able to offer data-enabled creativity support by generating high-quality solutions comparable to human designers. This opens up an imaginary space for designers and brings new possibilities for design tools. In this study, we proposed a hybrid prototype method that synergistically combines physical models and generative artificial intelligence (AI) in the conceptual design stage. Correspondingly, we developed a hybrid prototype system to implement the proposed method. We conducted a comparative user study with 45 designers who completed a design task using the physical prototype method, standalone generative AI and the hybrid prototype method, respectively. Our results verified the effectiveness of the hybrid prototype method and investigated its mechanism in supporting creativity. Finally, we discussed the application value and optimisation space of the hybrid prototype method.},

Therefore, based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Self-Determination Theory (SDT), this study adopts the method of structural equation model to deeply understand the influencing factors of college students' dishonest behaviors in online learning under the background of generative artificial intelligence. The results show that attitude, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norm all have a significant positive impact on behavior intention of dishonesty when online learning. Specifically, the attitude of dishonest behaviors in online learning is influenced by autonomous motivation (e.g., intrinsic interest, self-improvement) and controlled motivation (e.g., external rewards, avoidance of punishments); perceived behavioral control is influenced by autonomous motivation, controlled motivation, and moral obligation; and the subjective norm is not only affected by autonomous motivation but also by moral obligation. Based on this, this study proposes some interventions to mitigate dishonest behaviors in online learning to create a good learning atmosphere for the online learning environment.},

As a mixed-abilities team, we investigated student experiences with GenAI tools by collecting survey and interview responses from 62 and 21 students with disabilities, respectively, across two universities to measure students’ use of GenAI tools and their perspectives on the impact of these tools in ways related to disability, university support, and sense of belonging. Despite concerns over potential risks of GenAI and unclear university policies, students described GenAI tools as a useful resource for personalizing learning, promoting self-care, and assisting with important self-advocacy work. Guidance demonstrating safe, acceptable uses of GenAI tools, along with clear policies and resources that acknowledge diverse student needs, were desired. We discuss implications of these tools for accessibility and inclusion in higher education.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, generative artificial intelligence has shown strong application potential in various fields, and low code development has become a popular choice for quickly building application systems due to its efficient and easy-to-use characteristics. With the continuous updates and iterations of web front-end development technology, how to improve learners' practical abilities and development efficiency has become an important issue in the field of vocational education. Therefore, we have designed an innovative web front-end development course training platform that combines the automation generation ability of generative artificial intelligence and the fast construction advantage of low code development. In platform design, we fully utilize the automated generation capability of generative artificial intelligence to achieve intelligent generation and layout optimization of front-end page elements. At the same time, with the help of the visual programming interface and component-based development methods of low code development platforms, the front-end development process is simplified, the technical threshold is lowered, and students can focus more on the implementation of business logic and creative expression.},

Amid the rapid development of image-generative AI, Midjourney acts as an "assistive creative tool" in the creation of Chinese landscape paintings. The visual effects generated by key descriptive words play a significant role in guiding landscape painters' innovative thinking, brush and ink techniques, and creative concepts, even forming new circles of innovative thinking. The process of "human-machine interaction" is analyzed through the principles of human-machine cooperative Chinese landscape painting, using Midjourney training as an example to explore the mechanisms and processes of generating stylized painting schemes.},

  abstract = {In the face of the high requirements of vocational education for practical skills training, as well as the poor results and high costs of traditional training, this study aims to build an efficient and intelligent virtual training and simulation operation platform by introducing generative artificial intelligence technology to improve teaching quality and learning efficiency. This paper uses the adversarial generation ability of GAN and combines it with the knowledge graph in the field of vocational education to generate a high-fidelity and scalable virtual training environment. The variational autoencoder (VAE) is used to dynamically adjust the scene parameters to adapt to the needs of different majors and skill levels. Based on the Transformer multimodal dialogue model, a real-time operation guidance system integrating virtual and real is constructed. The physical engine is combined to simulate the feedback of equipment operation, and the long short-term memory network (LSTM) is used to capture the characteristics of the trainee's operation sequence, dynamically predict potential errors and trigger correction prompts. This paper also uses the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to build a personalized evaluation agent, using the trainee's operation data as the state space to generate targeted training suggestions. The average operation accuracy of the experimental group students reaches 89.715\%, the highest skill assessment pass rate reaches 100\%, and the overall distribution is more concentrated, reducing the cost of practical training. In addition, teachers and students highly evaluated the teaching adaptability, operation guidance and error correction functions of the platform. The teaching platform proposed in this study provides a new path and strategy for the modernization of vocational education.},

Therefore, the incorporation of generative AI images within the framework of design theory becomes crucial to interpret and refine design processes and design thinking. This research aims to explore the application of generative AI images in design semiotics, utilizing design theory as its foundation. By integrating design processes and incorporating design case studies, the study seeks to analyze how generative AI images can be effectively applied in design semiotics.

  abstract = {Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence are poised to reshape introductory programming education, challenging conventional teaching methodologies. This paper presents a scoping review that explores the current understanding of integrating generative artificial intelligence tools in the learning of introductory programming. Through an analysis of 28 selected studies, this review provides a snapshot of the landscape in mid-2024, presenting benefits, concerns, and recommendations surrounding the use of generative artificial intelligence within programming education. It finds insufficient guidance on how to implement recommended pedagogical strategies, limited consideration of student perceptions and experiences, and a predominance of short study time frames. Additionally, there is a significant research gap in second-level education, particularly in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The paper discusses how these gaps signal a need for more human-centered approaches in the current research. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research, aiming to inspire further inquiry and advance the understanding of generative artificial intelligence’s role in programming education from a human-centered perspective.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) technology, its application in the field of education has gradually become an important direction of teaching reform. This paper takes the course of “Java Framework Application “in software technology major as the research object, discusses how to empower the traditional teaching mode through AIGC technology, and improve the teaching quality and practical effect of the course. Firstly, the pain points existing in the current Java framework course teaching were analyzed, including the shortage of case resources, the single practice scene, and the lack of personalized guidance. Secondly, combined with the technical characteristics of AIGC, a multi-dimensional application model covering code generation, intelligent question answering, scene simulation and learning effect evaluation was constructed. By introducing a large language model to automatically generate customized case codes of mainstream frameworks such as Spring Boot and MyBatis, conversational AI is used to assist students to solve development problems in real time, and a virtual project scene is constructed based on generative technology to strengthen engineering practice ability. Teaching practice shows that the application of AIGC technology greatly improves students 'code standardization and project development efficiency, and teachers can accurately locate learning weaknesses through intelligent analysis tools. This study provides a reusable implementation path for the intelligent transformation of technology courses, and verifies the empowering value of generative artificial intelligence in the field of vocational education, which has important reference significance for the optimization of future curriculum system.},

  abstract = {As artificial intelligence becomes an everyday presence across education, arts and creative technologies, and cultural heritage, the interaction between users and intelligent systems deserves critical examination. This submission presents a systematic review of 95 case studies, 64 in education, 14 in arts, and 17 in heritage — selected via a PRISMA-guided search and expert screening — to map how generative artificial intelligence is embedded at both the interface and interaction levels. We identify nine interface archetypes (e.g., conversational, adaptive dashboards, immersive environments interfaces), eight interaction patterns (e.g., conversing, collaborating, manipulating),and eight main user experience dimensions as observed in case studies. Our analysis further categorizes six modality-usage patterns—from text, image, audio, and video up to fully multi-modal workflows and distillsfour main categories of end-to-end application pipelines. Notably, only two studies were found to articulate design-phase guidelines, and limitations cluster around output quality, ethical risks, and a lack of longitudinal evaluations. We conclude with limitations observed and future research focused on explainability, participatory design, and sustained field deployments. This synthesis provides a foundation for researchers and practitioners seeking to harness generative artificial intelligence as a responsive, human-centered collaborator.},

However, existing image-based methods generate results with blurred boundaries, graphic-based methods produce results with poor diversity, and rendering-based methods synthesize inconsistent images. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a novel controllable 3D urban generation pipeline, which consists of urban layouts and 3D scenes generation. Specifically, we introduce the graph dynamic attention model and the dummy node to enhance the diversity of the generated results. We also design a scene asset matching method based on the CLIP model to controllably generate 3D urban scenes. Experimental results indicate that the diversity of the generated results surpasses that of existing methods, and the generated 3D urban scenes are of good consistency.},

The study reports the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Variational Autocoders (VAE) in artistic style extraction from a large number of datasets and generating innovative images with regional cultural features. The study draws from cultural anthropology's "Three Elements of Culture Theory" in examining the material, organizational and spiritual dimensions. The study identifies three methods of cultural translation: direct translation, consecutive translation, and indirect translation. The study utilizes these frameworks in examining innovative solutions to expressing Henan's regional culture in modern cultural products. It demonstrates how to achieve cultural dissemination and inheritance and enhance cultural identity and global influence in the context of globalization. The study also examines the potential of AI-based image generation in cultural creative design, thus offering a new framework for perceiving and examining the role of computer technology in cultural translation and innovation.},

It is important to investigate how special education teachers perceive and use GAI for two distinct instructional tasks: instructional enrichment and accommodations. Although the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) has been extensively used to study technology adoption, its application to GAI in special education is underrepresented. This gap is critical as special education teachers must address diverse needs of students with multiple disabilities. Moreover, limited research had examined how TAM dimensions vary across different tasks. This late-breaking study revealed that teachers consistently rated GAI lower for accommodations across all TAM dimensions, with particularly differences in Intention to Use and Actual Use. The results highlighted the complexities of adopting GAI for distinct instructional purposes. Although GAI demonstrated potential for supporting instructional enrichment, its inability to generate individualized recommendations limited its effectiveness for accommodations.},

  abstract = {In the contemporary flourishing digital economy, advancements in artificial intelligence are incessantly reconfiguring the capital market landscape. This study commences with the industry perturbation instigated by the DeepSeek large - model to explore the interactive mechanisms between financial public opinion and capital markets during technological innovation events. Through the comprehensive utilization of methods such as literature review, case analysis, social network analysis, and regression analysis, and drawing on 12,329 Weibo public opinion data points and high - frequency trading data from 16 A - share DeepSeek concept stocks, a novel “technology decoding – market response” dual - path model is constructed. The study reveals that technology - related public opinion gradually infiltrates the financial domain via a three - stage progression: “professional decoding – industry restructuring – investment decision - making.” Technology bloggers assume a pivotal role in information dissemination, as evidenced by an intermediary centrality of 0.29. The data further indicate that for each one - standard - deviation increment in public opinion intensity, the excess return of concept stocks surges by 1.8\% after 36 hours (p = 0.03), whereas the impact of sentiment polarity on stock prices is not statistically significant (β = 0.04, p = 0.41).Adopting an integrated perspective from journalism and behavioral finance, this research elucidates the propagation patterns of technology - related public opinion and its inherent connections with capital markets, and it formulates a “technology–finance” public opinion governance framework. These findings provide crucial theoretical underpinnings and practical guidelines for the prevention of financial risks associated with technology - related public opinion, thereby having far - reaching implications for optimizing financial market regulation and enhancing public opinion management systems.},

The variable scales involved in the experiments were mature scales, and ANOVA and the process in SPSS were used for testing.Findings–Study 1 indicates that followers react negatively to influencers' adoption of GenAI for social media production, which is mitigated when influencers engage in honesty-based motive explanation disclosure. Study 2 reveals that influencer motive attribution and perceived influencers' authenticity play chain-mediated roles in the effects of GenAI's adoption of disclosure type on followers' attitudes and behaviors.Originality/value–First, this study extends the GenAI marketing literature, which is still in its infancy, to provide a novel idea and framework for studying social media content creation by GenAI. Second, this study draws on the literature in the field of sponsored disclosure to further demonstrate the potential effectiveness of similar motive explanation for this approach.},

In addition, being able to fully understand code is increasingly important in a world where students have access to generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as GitHub Copilot. One effective solution is to utilise code comprehension questions, where a marker asks questions about a submission to gauge understanding, this can also have the side effect of helping to detect plagiarism. However, this approach is time consuming and can be difficult and/or expensive to scale.

To aid in this effort, we designed an open-ended generative AI project for the freshmen taking our general-education introduction to computing course. Students were required to team with generative AI to create something beyond what they alone (or the AI alone) could accomplish. Upon completion, students submitted a short written critical analysis documenting their experiences and presented a three-minute demonstration of their project in class. Despite limited course coverage of AI and generative AI prior to this project, we were impressed by the creativity and sophistication of the submitted final products as well as the breadth of generative AI tools explored. Student reflections on the experience illustrated numerous insights into the strengths and limitations of the tools they employed. Our results underscore that students can learn about the benefits and limitations of generative AI in as little as a single assignment and that covering such topics need not require extensive amounts of course time and resources.},

This process led to self-scrutiny through self-portrait that bridges personal and research. While generative artificial intelligence ignited creativity, it brought authenticity, originality, and tensions with ethics. These concerns are addressed through themes such as attribution transparency, the ethics of relying on non-human solutions and balancing inspiration versus imitation. The pictorial shares extracts from a two-year digital sketchbook that reflects how GAI can support artists in times of crisis and contributes to broader conversations about GAI's role in art practice.

While Generative AI has a multitude of exciting applications for the fields of writing, coding, and graphic design, its usage to personalize our virtual space has not yet been explored. In this paper, we investigate the application of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) to personalize our virtual spaces and enhance the metaverse experience. To this end, we present a pipeline to enable users to customize their virtual spaces. Moreover, we explore the hardware resources and latency required for personalized spaces, as well as user acceptance of the AI-generated spaces. Comprehensive user studies follow extensive system experiments. Our research evaluates users' perceptions of two generated spaces: panoramic images and 3D virtual spaces. According to our findings, users have shown a great interest in 3D personalized spaces, and the practicality and immersion of 3D space generation tools surpass panoramic space generation tools.},

  abstract = {Medical image analysis is essential for accurate disease diagnosis, with multimodal imaging offering complementary information to enhance diagnostic precision. However, current GAN architectures exhibit limitations in feature fusion efficiency, synthesized image quality, and classification accuracy. In this study, a GAN-based multimodal medical image generation and classification model was constructed. First, features are extracted using multi-scale receptive fields, key channels are enhanced by combining the channel attention mechanism, and the cross-enhanced fusion module realizes the fusion of MRI and PET features. In addition, Generator 3D is responsible for generating realistic medical images and classifying diseases through the classification header. Discriminator 3D is used to discriminate the realism of the images. Meanwhile, a comprehensive loss function is designed to optimize the generator's performance by combining adversarial loss, correlation loss, mean loss, and classification loss. The experimental results show that the proposed method can generate high-quality medical images and perform well on the classification task. It effectively improves the performance of medical image analysis and provides strong support for clinical diagnosis.},

This makes it bad at telling the important features and not good at working with different design cases.This study tries to make generative AI better at designing Wind-Responsive Passive Building Facades by using the K-means clustering algorithm.First, this study built a dataset with facade images, weather conditions, material types, and size info. Then, using the K-means clustering algorithm, we picked out key features and grouped the buildings by type. The goal is to give generative AI a better kind of visual data to learn from.Based on that, we made a three-level prompt structure to help generative AI work better with different design tasks.This study not only builds a clear method between finding building features and making prompts, but also gives ideas and steps for using generative AI more in sustainable building design.},

In this roadmap for artificial intelligence in software engineering, we highlight the recent deep impact of artificial intelligence on software engineering by discussing successful stories of applications of artificial intelligence to classic and new software development challenges. We identify the new challenges that the software engineering community has to address in the coming years to successfully apply artificial intelligence in software engineering, and we share our research roadmap toward the effective use of artificial intelligence in the software engineering profession, while still protecting fundamental human values.We spotlight three main areas that challenge the research in software engineering: the use of generative artificial intelligence and large language models for engineering large software systems, the need of large and unbiased datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating deep learning and large language models for software engineering, and the need of a new code of digital ethics to apply artificial intelligence in software engineering.},

  abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to changes in educational practices by creating opportunities for personalized learning and immediate support. Computer science student perceptions and behaviors towards GenAI tools have been studied, but the effects of such tools on student learning have yet to be determined conclusively. We investigate the impact of GenAI tools on computing students' performance in a database course and aim to understand why students use GenAI tools in assignments. Our mixed-methods study (N=226) asked students to self-report whether they used a GenAI tool to complete a part of an assignment and why. Our results reveal that students utilizing GenAI tools performed better on the assignment part in which LLMs were permitted but did worse in other parts of the assignment and in the course overall. Also, those who did not use GenAI tools viewed more discussion board posts and participated more than those who used ChatGPT. This suggests that using GenAI tools may not lead to better skill development or mental models, at least not if the use of such tools is unsupervised, and that engagement with official course help supports may be affected. Further, our thematic analysis of reasons for using or not using GenAI tools, helps understand why students are drawn to these tools. Shedding light into such aspects empowers instructors to be proactive in how to encourage, supervise, and handle the use or integration of GenAI into courses, fostering good learning habits.},

However, assisting in creative tasks without getting in the way of the artist’s workflow can be challenging. Since there is no "correct" answer in creative works for the machine to steer towards, the machine must gauge the "goodness" or "badness" of its actions by watching the user’s response. We present our system, ‘Hero’, for eliciting and developing interactions around creative machines, particularly drawing machines. It uses multi-modal information about the user to steer when it should intervene in the creative process. We are using this system in user studies and interviews with artists to understand what modalities they would use to interact with and give feedback to a machine without disrupting their usual sense of creative workflow. This paper outlines this project’s background, Hero’s current system design, ongoing user experiments, and our planned future work to develop a mixed-initiative, multi-modal collaborative machine for creative tasks.

  abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) offers numerous opportunities to revolutionise teaching and learning in Computing Education (CE). However, educators have expressed concerns that students may over-rely on GenAI and use these tools to generate solutions without engaging in the learning process. While substantial research has explored GenAI use in CE, and many Computer Science (CS) educators have expressed their opinions and suggestions on the subject, there remains little consensus on implementing curricula and assessment changes.In this paper, we describe our experiences with using GenAI in CS-focused educational settings and the changes we have implemented accordingly in our teaching in recent years since the popularisation of GenAI. From our experiences, we propose two primary actions for the CE community: 1) redesign take-home assignments to incorporate GenAI use and assess students on their process of using GenAI to solve a task rather than simply on the final product; 2) redefine the role of educators to emphasise metacognitive aspects of learning, such as critical thinking and self-evaluation. This paper presents and discusses these stances and outlines several practical methods to implement these strategies in CS classrooms. Then, we advocate for more research addressing the concrete impacts of GenAI on CE, especially those evaluating the validity and effectiveness of new teaching practices.},

At the same time the descriptions of competences are mostly based on textual descriptions often in informal style targeted towards different audiences making descriptions vague and harder to compare. Formal models for the specification of competences exist for some time and even semantic models are being developed, e.g., the European Learning Model. These different approaches lead to a gap between formal and informal competence descriptions that require manual efforts of curriculum designer to maintain. This research borrows the concept of Deep and Surface representation models from the field of linguistics to unify the different approaches. Additionally, it focuses on the functionality of Generative Artificial Intelligence in the form of Large Language Models to close the aforementioned gap. It demonstrates the potential of the technology in both directions and discusses application potential of the concept.},

  abstract = {This experience report reflects on a longitudinal project aimed at determining ways that generative artificial intelligence (gen AI) can be leveraged as a pedagogical tool to assist in professionalizing students’ rhetorical understanding and use of the tool beyond the academy. Since ChatGPT launched, we have studied students’ engagement with gen AI tools to bridge academic and professional uses, believing that knowing when and how to deploy such tools can facilitate the gen AI literacy students need to have upon entering their professional careers. This report posits that students’ participatory design in the pedagogical structure is vital for creating localized practices that translate to tangible forms of AI literacies.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is driving transformative shifts in workforce dynamics, profoundly influencing how workers perceive their skills, efficacy, and professional roles. This research introduces the concept of AI Psychological Empowerment to examine how AI advancements impact workers' self-perception and empowerment, particularly among historically marginalized groups: i.e., Focusing on Australian immigrant workers of Asian descent, this study explores how AI Psychological Empowerment is both constructed and experienced, reshaping immigrant workers' self-efficacy, workplace engagement, and overall professional identity. Drawing on a comprehensive, nationwide dataset, the findings reveal unique pathways through which AI facilitates psychological empowerment and agency, addressing critical gaps in workplace representation and voice for immigrant employees. This study highlights the nuanced interactions between AI adoption, cultural dynamics, and empowerment, offering valuable insights for policymakers and designers on creating inclusive AI applications for diverse workforce populations.},
